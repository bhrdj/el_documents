4. CHILD INTERACTION STRATEGIES Page 3 of XX
4.1 Child Development in General
4.1.1 Holistic Child Development
1. “Holistic” and "Development"
○ Holistic refers to “whole-person.” Development means growth and change.
○ Holistic child development includes all the growth and change happening in a child, from
birth through early adulthood.
2. The child’s whole-person includes their:
○ Personal self: Physical body, emotions, thinking brain, relationships with others
○ External connections to: Family, friends, neighborhood, institutions like schools and
governments etc.
4.1.2 Personalized Care - Attentive and Flexible
What is personalized care?
● It is focusing on a child as an individual with unique needs and a unique developmental pace.
● It is tailoring a child’s care to respond to their unique needs and developmental pace.
● It is tracking a child’s development across all aspects of development to identify areas where
they may need more support or greater challenge.
● A caregiver’s response to a child should be based on the child’s verbal and nonverbal cues,
their response to current needs, interests, and emotional states.
Choosing the EL technique to apply
● There are over 20 EL techniques tailored for different occurrences.
● The application of EL techniques depends on:
○ Interests of the child
○ Desired behaviour
○ Needs of the child
EL_CgManual_CURRENT_v016 November 5, 2025

4. CHILD INTERACTION STRATEGIES Page 4 of XX
○ Safety of the child
○ Holistic development path of the child
○ Child environmental needs and experiences
● It is not easy to deduce a child’s needs or moods, but you have to try.
● As a caregiver, you need to be attentive to holistic development path, needs, safety, current interests
and behaviours and history of the child.
● Once you are attentive, be flexible and adjust the EL caregiving techniques and strategies.
4.1.3 Four Primary Aspects of Child Development
● 4.1.3.1 Why should we separate out different aspects of development?
● It helps us organize our thinking about the child.
○ We can use the list of aspects like a checklist for checking on children and communicating
about the child between caregivers and family members.
● EL prioritizes all aspects of the child’s development.
○ The main categories are: physical, cognitive, emotional, and social.
EL_CgManual_CURRENT_v016 November 5, 2025

4. CHILD INTERACTION STRATEGIES Page 5 of XX
● Each child develops at their own pace, with different speeds of development in different aspects.
4.1.3.2 Physical Development
Growth:
○ Growth of the body and brain, in size and detail, over time.
Motor skills:
○ Gross motor skill development:
■ Learning and controlling actions with large movements of the arms, legs, and body.
■ Examples: walking, running, pushing a door, and hitting a ball.
○ Fine motor skill development:
■ Learning and controlling actions with careful and small movements of the fingers and
other body parts.
■ Examples: opening and closing a koji deadbolt, wearing and removing shoes, and
using a pencil to write or draw on paper.
Sensory capabilities:
○ Ability to focus the lenses of the eyes
■ Shifting between seeing detail up close, and from far away.
○ Becoming familiar with different object textures by feeling them with the hands.
■ Sand, a cement wall, a steel door, a sofaset
■ Hot versus cold; wet versus dry
○ Becoming aware of feelings from all different parts of the body.
■ Wind in the face, taste, smell, hearing, etc.
4.1.3.3 Cognitive Development
Cognitive development involves the way children learn to think, understand, and solve problems.
EL_CgManual_CURRENT_v016 November 5, 2025

4. CHILD INTERACTION STRATEGIES Page 6 of XX
○ As children grow, they develop memory, reasoning skills, the ability to understand cause and
effect,etc
○ Problem solving opportunities
Examples of problem solving opportunities[just enough challenges without testing]
○ Levels of problem solving opportunities
○ Level 1
○ Is when you do an activity and help the child on how to do it
○ Level 2
○ Is allowing the child to do it while giving instructions
○ Level 3
○ Is allowing the child to do it independently without any instructions
○ Eg:
○ When you have 3 drawn pictures of Mbwa,bata na kuku
○ Level 1..caregiver assign named animals and welcome child second opinion
○ Level 2…same, but don't idea it first let the child have the moment to try to idea the card
○ Level 3..shuffle the cards let the child play unattended,then ask for explanation.[trick
tujifanishe,tufanyiane]
4.1.3.4 Emotional Development
Children gradually learn to identify, express, and manage their emotions.
○ They learn to recognize their own feelings, show them through actions, and identify them
with language.
○ Children can develop empathy for others. That is, when they notice another child or adult
person experiencing an emotion, then this may cause them to experiencing a similar emotion
themselves.
EL_CgManual_CURRENT_v016 November 5, 2025

4. CHILD INTERACTION STRATEGIES Page 7 of XX
○ Children can learn to manage their own emotions.
■ Extreme expressions of excitement and frustration are usually not welcome around
other people.
■ Kids learn to express appropriate emotions according to normal social expectations of
respect and politeness.
4.1.3.5 Social Development
Social skills develop as children interact with adults and other children.
○ This includes sharing, cooperating, and communicating.
○ Using these skills, they begin gaining experience building and maintaining relationships with
peers and adults.
4.1.4 Cross-cutting Aspects of Child Development
4.1.4.1 Language Development
What does language include?
○ Body and hand gestures, grunts, mouth noises, and any purposeful nonverbal communication
are part of language.
○ Language begins with babbling, and progresses to full speech.
○ Words and sentence structures help children express their thoughts, ask questions, and engage
in conversations.
Cross-cutting connections between language development and primary aspects of child development:
○ Receiving and creating language requires physical development.
○ Processing language depends on cognitive development.
○ Language is linked with social development, as meaningful interactions and relationships
accelerate language development, and vice/versa.
EL_CgManual_CURRENT_v016 November 5, 2025

4. CHILD INTERACTION STRATEGIES Page 8 of XX
4.1.4.2 Moral Development:
Moral development connects across emotions, cognitive thinking, and social interactions.
As children grow, they begin to understand the difference between right and wrong and the gray areas in
between.
Their moral reasoning evolves through interactions with parents, caregivers, and other children, including
structured guidance from adults.
4.2 EL Child Development Framework: Motor, Brakes, and Pilot Controls
4.2.1 Motor, Brakes, and Pilot Controls - The Overall Metaphor
3. Motor: Capabilities and creativity
○ Drive holistically healthy child development.
4. Safety brake: Rewards and consequences
○ Gently positive rewards, gently negative consequences
○ These decrease creativity as they increase discipline.
5. Airplane takeoff pilot controls: Levels 1, 2, 3 of development, motivation, and challenge:
○ Maturing toddlers and preschoolers develop goals and priorities, and become passionate
about these learning priorities.
○ This is an opportunity for the caregiver to coordinate their energies toward self-motivated
takeoff – in their journey of lifelong learning!
6. This illustrative metaphor connects with our “gari” and “ndege” classes.
○ Gari class deals more with the motor and brakes, as their abstract sense of cause/effect is not
yet as thoroughly developed.
○ Ndege class has an understanding of cause and effect, which connects them to the world of
self-motivation, and eventually to independent flight.
EL_CgManual_CURRENT_v016 November 5, 2025

4. CHILD INTERACTION STRATEGIES Page 9 of XX
4.2.2 Motor: Creativity, Capabilities
4.2.2.1 Motor Metaphor in-depth
● What do motors do?
○ Receive energy as input
○ Produce rotating cycles of movement as
output
● What are the child's "energy" and "movement"?
○ The child's energy comes from their
playful curiosity and creative joy.
○ The movement resulting from a well-organized motor is the child's healthy development in
all aspects. This can be seen as their capabilities increase.

7. The cycle looks like this:
○ a stack (📚) representing a situation or state of being, moving into:
○ an arrow (⬅) representing a change or flow, connecting to:
○ a second situation “stack” (📚) moving into:
○ a second arrow (➡) representing a change or flow…
○ …connecting back to the first stack ♻.
8. Experiences of fun and success (right-side stack 📚)
○ These are the biggest drivers of a child’s learning and growth.
○ Fun and success leave good memories, motivating children to chase after similar experiences.
9. Courageous creative efforts (lower movement ⬅)
○ These efforts exercise kids physically and mentally.
○ The exercise increases the kids' capabilities.
10. Stock of abilities and powers (left-side stack 📚)
○ A child has some level of abilities and powers at any moment.
○ The way a child shows those abilities changes – with the environment, and over time.
○ The Bayley Scales assessment tries to measure the child's abilities based on their age
development expectations.
11. Enabling fun and success (upper movement ➡)
○ Growing capabilities means that a child will encounter fresh challenges.
○ A developing child will often succeed against new challenges. They will be able to play new
games that they weren't able to play before, or play old games in new ways.
○ These fresh successes are memorable and motivating!
EL_CgManual_CURRENT_v016 November 5, 2025

4. CHILD INTERACTION STRATEGIES Page 11 of XX
4.2.2.2.2 Types of experiences of fun and success (right-side stack 📚)
12. Exploring is a way that the child accesses external stimulation. The child actively moves through
and observes their environment, using five senses to find out all the information they can.
13. Experimenting is an even more active way to get stimulation from the external environment. The
child engages their surroundings, trying to change things with bodily actions, or using one object on
another. The child may feel especially excited and empowered to learn about cause-effect
relationships, for instance, that the light switch may cause the lamp to turn on its brightness, etc.
14. Imagining is a simulation of a scenario in the child’s mind. It’s an expression of internal creativity,
where the child has learned enough about something in the environment that they can experience a
new story about it, without needing to explore or experiment every time.
15. Creating is when a child builds on their imagination to bring something from their imagined stories
out into the real world.
4.2.2.2.4 Courageous creative efforts (lower movement ⬅)
4.2.2.2.4.1 Growth through effort
These efforts exercise kids physically and mentally.
The exercise increases the kids' capabilities.
*** need a basic concept of why/how effort causes growth...???
4.2.2.2.4.1 Peak-end
● The "peak" refers to the most joyful, exciting, or engaging parts of a child's activity or game.
● Always end the game/activity when the child:
○ is getting interested
○ is almost getting excited
○ wants more engagement
● This helps the child to:
EL_CgManual_CURRENT_v016 November 5, 2025

4. CHILD INTERACTION STRATEGIES Page 12 of XX
○ yearn for more and value any moment when an adult/ caregiver plays a game with them.
○ not get bored with an activity easily.
○ treasure moments when an adult/caregiver is engaging with them.
○ have good memories and longings of activities/ games they have engaged with.
● Children may not remember all activities/games they engaged in during the day but will remember:
○ Exciting engagegemnts
○ Painful engagements
○ Shocking engagements
4.2.2.2.4.2 Ambivalent choices
This is offering choices for the child to decide.
● There are two types of choices:
○ Constrained or structured choices
■ Caregiver offers the child two or three options to choose from.
■ For example, "Do you want to play with a cat or dog?"
■ This is useful with children without a habit of good decision-making in this kind of
environment.
○ Open-ended choices
■ The adult/caregiver controls the environment, providing activity supplies etc. The
child is not restricted to making any choices, they choose what to do first, how to do
it, etc.
■ For example, a caregiver leads a child into a room where there is a tray on the floor
with modeling clay. Then the caregiver sits in a corner and begins reading a book to
themself silently, without giving further directions to the child.
■ This is useful with children whose basic behavior habits are good enough that they
can be independent and creative in this environment without misbehaving.
EL_CgManual_CURRENT_v016 November 5, 2025

4. CHILD INTERACTION STRATEGIES Page 13 of XX
● The choices should be:
○ Only what is acceptable to the caregiver/adult.
○ safe for both the child and the caregiver/ adult.
● In the making of choices:
○ The child is in control -- the child is the boss!
○ Whatever the child chooses is always "the best", and the caregiver should celebrate it.
● In making choices, the caregiver should not:
○ have a favourite or prefered choice,
○ think from an adult’s perspective,
○ react negatively due to the child’s choice.
● In making choices, the adult/ caregiver should:
○ provide choices that the caregiver is comfortable with,
○ support the choices that the child makes, using positive body language and expressions even
when the child fails to make the caregiver's secretly-preferred choice.
○ be sincere with the child, by putting in effort to think from the child’s perspective.
○ These builds trust with the child.
● Benefits of ambivalent choices to the child include:
○ Unconscious decision to focus on an activity/ game.
○ Enhances task or activity performance from the child.
4.2.2.2.5 Stock of abilities and powers
16. Physical abilities that we can look for in a child:
○ Mobility (gross motor): Rolling over, crawling on belly, crawling on hands and knees,
walking while supporting balance with hands, walking, running and jumping, socially
intentional body postures.
○ Manipulation (fine motor): Moving arms and legs, coordinated reaching/touching/pushing,
coordinated whole-hand grabbing, separate movement of fingers, intentional large object
EL_CgManual_CURRENT_v016 November 5, 2025

4. CHILD INTERACTION STRATEGIES Page 14 of XX
manipulation like plastic chairs or large dolls, intentional small tool use such as koji or
pencil/paper, refinement of tool use like careful hand posture for writing.
17. Mental abilities that we can see in a child:
○ Recognition:
■ Seeing a person's face and identifying it is the parent
○ Understanding:
■ Responding appropriately to familiar gestures or words.
○ Voice:
■ Recognizing and reacting to familiar voices, such as turning towards a parent’s voice.
18. Physical abilities that we can't see as caregivers:
○ Strengthening of muscles and joints, preparing for future motor skills like rolling, crawling
and sitting.
○ Development of internal coordination for balance and movement.
○ Growth of reflexive responses that later become voluntary actions.
19. Mental abilities that we can’t see as caregivers:
○ Formation of early memory pathways.
○ Recognition of familiar voices, sounds and patterns.
○ Emotional bonding and security development.
20. Encouraging intrinsic motivation
○ Stop when the child is having the most fun - reference: "Peak-End" -Daniel Kahneman
○ Offer ambivalent choices - reference: "Internal Drive" -Petunia Lee
21. Arrange opportunities for fun and success
○ Ensure emotional safety through a healthy environment and community
○ Arrange self-play opportunities without distractions
○ Provide just-enough-challenge activities where the child can build confidence through small
independent successes.
EL_CgManual_CURRENT_v016 November 5, 2025

4. CHILD INTERACTION STRATEGIES Page 15 of XX
22. Arrange an environment and timetable that extends the child’s abilities, enabling them to try more
diverse challenges.
○ Use catchy memory tricks like songs, games, jokes, and funny pictures to speed up their
recognition.
○ Scheduled activities and other stimulations according to a calendar of decreasing-frequency,
to help the child pick-up physical and mental abilities.

New Caregiver Training Plan for Daycare
1. Orientation & Policies
● Introduction to the daycare’s mission, philosophy, and daily routines
● Review of employee handbook and code of conduct
● Attendance, dress code, confidentiality, and communication protocols
● Licensing regulations and compliance requirements

Carrying Out Conversations with Children
● Speak at their level—use simple, clear words.
● Listen carefully and show interest in what they say.
● Ask open-ended questions (e.g., “What are you building?”).
● Give them time to respond.
EL_CgManual_CURRENT_v016 November 5, 2025

4. CHILD INTERACTION STRATEGIES Page 19 of XX
4.x Communicating with Children
4.1.1
● Incorporate Play into Conversations:
○ Children learn best when they’re having fun, so use playful language and engage in activities
that make them smile.
○ For example, if you’re playing with animal toys, you can say, “The cow says moo! Can you
say moo?” or “Let’s march like elephants!” This kind of playful interaction keeps them
engaged and makes learning feel like a game.
● Sing and Use Rhymes:
○ Songs and rhymes are excellent tools for language development because they introduce
rhythm, repetition, and new words.
○ You could sing “The Wheels on the Bus” while doing the actions, or recite a simple rhyme
like “gari ya moshi linaenda sana” and encourage the child to join in with the words or
actions.
● Use expressive tone and Body Language:
○ Change your tone of voice to match the situation—speak softly when something is quiet or
whisper when it’s a secret, and raise your voice in excitement when something is fun.
○ Complement your words with body language, like clapping when you’re happy or pretending
to tiptoe when you’re being quiet.
○ This makes the conversation more dynamic and engaging.
● Interactive Reading:
○ Reading with a child is a great way to build language skills.
○ Encourage the child to read by allowing them to turn pages as you read aloud with them.
EL_CgManual_CURRENT_v016 November 5, 2025

4. CHILD INTERACTION STRATEGIES Page 20 of XX
○ We should allow the child to turn pages independently but first we have to give them the
minimal assistance by just lifting the pages a little bit.(hand under the page technique)
○ Always be patient for them to open the book by themselves and if the child loses the interest
you should not chase for the interest,but allow the child to come back naturally
○ Always use the book or the or the flashcard as something enjoyable not boring
○ We should apply hand under the page technique when training the child how to turn pages
independently.
○ You should try to be creative even if you are doing one on one flashcards sessions.
○
○ Encourage the child to point, respond, or even finish a sentence if they know the words.
○ This makes reading interactive and helps them connect with the words.
● Encourage Them to Communicate:
○ When the child is trying to say something, whether it’s a word, a sound, or even just a
gesture, give them time to express themselves.
○ Avoid finishing their sentences or rushing them. Instead, show that you’re listening by
making eye contact, nodding, and responding positively to whatever they say or do.
● Respond to Their Interests:
○ Pay attention to what catches the child’s interest and use it as a conversation starter.
○ For example, if they’re fascinated by a truck passing by, you might say, “Look at that big
truck! It’s so loud! What color is it?” Engaging with their interests shows that you value their
thoughts and encourages them to share more with you.
● Talk Throughout the Day
EL_CgManual_CURRENT_v016 November 5, 2025

4. CHILD INTERACTION STRATEGIES Page 21 of XX
○ Use routine activities like snack time, dressing, or clean-up as opportunities to chat and teach
new words.
○ For example, during snack time, you can talk about the different foods, their colors, and how
they taste: “You’re eating a banana.
○ It’s yellow and sweet!” During clean-up, you can say, “Let’s put the toys away. We’re
cleaning up!”
● Encourage Independence with Language:
○ Encourage the child to use words to express their needs and desires during daily routines.
○ For example, if they’re reaching for a toy, prompt them by saying, “Do you want the truck?
Can you say ‘truck’?” This not only helps them practice their language skills but also fosters
a sense of independence.
The rules of the language development program for young babies:
Do
● Always listen to the baby.
● Look as if you are listening.
● Be willing to wait for a response.
● Accept the fact that the baby decides whether to respond or not,it is his choice.
● Respond to what he says.
● Welcome enthusiastically to every effort the baby makes to talk.
● Assign meaning to the specific sounds the baby says repeatedly.
● Use real words when talking to the baby.
Don’t
● Don’t use “baby talk” with the baby.
● Do not ignore the baby.
● Don’t ask a question and leave no time for him to answer.
EL_CgManual_CURRENT_v016 November 5, 2025

4. CHILD INTERACTION STRATEGIES Page 22 of XX
● Don’t neglect to answer him.
● Don’t imitate or make fun of the sound he makes.
● Don’t correct his pronunciation.
● Don’t try to force the child to answer or respond.
4.2. Using Flashcards During Routine Daycare Activity
● Staff should flash word flash cards to children during play, reading the words as he or she flashes
them to expose the child to more vocabulary.
4.3. Behavior and Habit Change (“Disciplining” the Kids)
4.3.1 Guiding principle for discipline in the daycare
● Disciplining young children in EL daycare without using corporal punishment involves a lot of
patience, clear communication, and positive support.
Here are some effective strategies:
4.3.1.1 Redirection
● Explanation
○ Young children have short attention spans and can be easily distracted.
○ Redirection involves shifting their focus from an undesirable behavior or situation to
something more appropriate or engaging.
○ This method helps prevent frustration and tantrums while teaching them acceptable
alternatives.
● Implementation
○ Identify the Misbehavior:
■ Observe what the child is doing that is inappropriate, such as throwing toys or pulling
another child’s hair, hitting other children, pushing , hitting or “chapa”
EL_CgManual_CURRENT_v016 November 5, 2025

4. CHILD INTERACTION STRATEGIES Page 23 of XX
○ Introduce a New Activity:
■ Calmly and eagerly introduce a different activity.
■ For example, if a child is throwing toys, you could say, “Let’s go build a tower with
these blocks!” or “Can you help me find all the red toys?”
○ Provide a Positive Alternative:
■ Offer a similar but safe alternative to the behavior.
■ If they are throwing objects, suggest throwing a softball in a designated play area
instead.
4.3.1.2 Setting Clear Boundaries
● Explanation:
○ Children at this young age are just beginning to understand rules and boundaries.
○ Clear and consistent rules help them learn what is expected of them, creating a sense of
security and order.
● Implementation:
○ Simple Language: Keep instructions short and direct. Instead of saying, “Please don’t do
that,” say, “Toys stay on Usethe shelf.”
● Be Consistent:
○ Consistency is key.
○ Make sure all caregivers follow the same rules and consequences to avoid confusing the
child.
● Explain the Why:
○ Even though children might not fully understand, explaining why certain behaviors are not
allowed helps them start to make connections.
○ For example, “We use gentle hands because hitting hurts our friends.”
EL_CgManual_CURRENT_v016 November 5, 2025

4. CHILD INTERACTION STRATEGIES Page 24 of XX
4.3.1.3 Positive Reinforcement
● Explanation
○ Positive reinforcement involves rewarding desired behavior to encourage it to be repeated.
○ This method helps children understand which behaviors are acceptable and gives them a
sense of accomplishment.
● Implementation:
○ Immediate Praise:
■ Offer immediate and specific praise when the child behaves well. For example,
“Thank you for sharing the toys with your friend!”
○ Use Body Language:
■ In addition to verbal praise, use smiles, claps, or high-fives to show approval.
○ Reward Systems:
■ Although very young children may not fully understand complex reward
systems, simple acknowledgments like stickers or stamps for good behavior
can be effective.
4.3.1.4 Offering Choices
● Explanation
○ Giving children choices helps them feel empowered and reduces resistance. It also teaches
decision-making skills in a controlled environment.
● Implementation:
○ Limited Options:
■ Offer two choices that both lead to the desired outcome. For example, “Do you want
to pick up the red blocks or the blue blocks?” This method avoids overwhelming the
child while still giving them a sense of control.
EL_CgManual_CURRENT_v016 November 5, 2025

4. CHILD INTERACTION STRATEGIES Page 25 of XX
■ Positive Framing:
■ Always frame the choices positively.
■ Instead of saying, “You can either stop crying or sit in the corner,” say, “Would you
like to sit with me or play with the toys?”
4.3.1.5 Time-In (Instead of Time-Out)
● Explanation
○ Time-in focuses on understanding the child’s feelings and teaching them how to manage their
emotions, rather than isolating them as a punishment.
○ This approach promotes emotional regulation and reinforces the bond between the child and
caregiver.
● Implementation:
○ Sit with the Child:
■ When a child is upset or acting out, sit with them in a quiet space. Hold their hand or
sit them on your lap, offering comfort and support.
○ Acknowledge Emotions:
■ Verbally acknowledge their feelings. “I see you’re upset because it’s time to clean up.
It’s okay to feel sad.”
○ Teach Calm-Down Techniques:
■ Help them calm down by teaching deep breathing, counting to five, or using a
calming toy.
4.3.1.6 Consistent Routines
● Explanation
○ Routines provide structure and predictability, which are essential for young children.
○ Knowing what to expect reduces anxiety and helps children feel secure, which in turn reduces
behavioral issues.
EL_CgManual_CURRENT_v016 November 5, 2025

4. CHILD INTERACTION STRATEGIES Page 26 of XX
● Implementation:
○ Daily Schedule:
■ Keep a consistent daily schedule for activities such as meals, naps, playtime, and
cleanup.
■ For example, always having snack time at 10:00 AM helps children anticipate what’s
next.
○ Transition Cues:
■ Use songs, visuals, or verbal cues to signal transitions between activities.
■ For example, a specific clean-up song can indicate that it’s time to put away toys.
○ Patience with Transitions:
■ Allow extra time for transitions, as young children often need more time to adjust
from one activity to another.
■ Never allow the children to walk alone in the hallway.
4.3.1.7 Modeling Appropriate Behavior
● Explanation
○ Children learn by observing the adults around them.
○ Modeling the behavior you want to see in children teaches them how to act in different
situations.
● Implementation:
○ Demonstrate Sharing and Cooperation:
■ Show how to share toys or take turns during play.
■ For example, “It’s my turn to play with the truck, and then it’s your turn.”
○ Use Calm Words and Tone:
■ When addressing a child, use a calm voice and kind words, even when correcting
behavior.
■ This teaches them to communicate calmly and respectfully.
EL_CgManual_CURRENT_v016 November 5, 2025

4. CHILD INTERACTION STRATEGIES Page 27 of XX
○ Show Empathy:
■ If a child is upset, model empathy by acknowledging their feelings. “I see that you’re
upset because the block tower fell down. Let’s build it together.”
4.3.1.8 Ignoring Minor Misbehavior
● Explanation
○ Sometimes, children act out to gain attention.
○ Ignoring minor misbehaviors can help extinguish them if they realize they won’t get the
desired response.
○ This method should be used selectively and paired with positive reinforcement for good
behavior.
● Implementation:
○ Assess the Behavior:
■ Determine if the behavior is a minor issue that can be safely ignored, like whining or
mild pouting.
○ Stay Neutral:
■ Avoid giving the behavior attention, whether positive or negative.
■ Remain neutral and continue with the activity at hand.
○ Reinforce Positive Behavior:
■ As soon as the child engages in appropriate behavior, provide positive reinforcement.
■ For example, if they stop whining and ask for something politely, praise them
immediately.
4.3.1.9 Using Simple Language
● Explanation
○ Young children are still developing their language skills, so using simple, clear language
helps them understand what you want from them.
EL_CgManual_CURRENT_v016 November 5, 2025

4. CHILD INTERACTION STRATEGIES Page 28 of XX
○ This method reduces confusion and frustration.
● Implementation:
○ Short Sentences:
■ Use short, direct sentences when giving instructions.
■ For example, “Sit down, please,” instead of a longer explanation.
○ Use Visuals and Gestures:
■ Combine words with gestures or pictures to help convey the message.
■ Pointing to a chair while saying “Sit” helps reinforce the command.
○ Repeat and Reinforce:
■ Repetition helps young children remember rules and instructions.
■ For example, consistently saying “Hands to yourself” and gently guiding their hands
away from others will help them learn.
4.3.1.10 Empathy and Understanding
● Explanation
○ Understanding a child’s perspective and showing empathy helps build trust and a secure
relationship.
○ It also teaches children to understand and express their own emotions in a healthy way.
● Implementation:
○ Acknowledge Feelings:
■ Validate the child’s emotions by naming what they’re feeling.
■ For example, “I see you’re frustrated because it’s hard to put the puzzle together.
■ Let’s try it together.”
○ Be Patient and Attentive:
■ Give the child your full attention when they’re upset.
■ This shows them that their feelings are important and that they can rely on you for
comfort.
EL_CgManual_CURRENT_v016 November 5, 2025

4. CHILD INTERACTION STRATEGIES Page 29 of XX
○ Teach Emotion Words:
■ Help children learn to express their feelings by teaching them words for different
emotions. “You’re feeling mad because your toy broke.
■ It’s okay to feel mad. Let’s see how we can fix it.
● EL daycares, uses these methods of discipline to foster a positive, supportive environment thus
helping children develop self-control, empathy, and good social skills without using any kind of
corporal punishment.
4.3.2 Creativity and discipline.
4.3.2.1 What are creativity and discipline?
● Creativity: is creating new ideas and new actions in a playful way.
● Discipline: is acting based on rules from an authority without questioning.
4.3.2.2 Rule to decide if creativity or discipline is better.
● Discipline is crucial when there is a risk of injury, damage to property, or financial loss.
● When discipline is necessary, it should be gentle and appropriate to the situation.
● For example, if a child is engaging in harmful behavior (e.g., playing with unsafe objects), discipline
should protect them from immediate harm.
● Gentle discipline, such as removing a toy or redirecting attention, is more effective than harsh
punishment.
● The goal is to guide behavior rather than suppress creativity.
4.3.2.3 How to develop creativity or discipline in a child
● Discipline:
○ There are rewards or punishments from authority.
○ Heavy reward/punishment results in heavy discipline.
○ Gentle reward/punishment results in gentle discipline.
EL_CgManual_CURRENT_v016 November 5, 2025

4. CHILD INTERACTION STRATEGIES Page 30 of XX
○ *even a gentle reward decreases creativity*
○ Gentle rewards and minimal punishments help preserve a child’s creative spirit, as they focus
more on the intrinsic joy of the activity rather than pleasing adults or avoiding punishment.
○ When discipline is necessary, it should be gentle and appropriate to the situation. For
example, if a child is engaging in harmful behavior (e.g., playing with unsafe objects),
discipline should protect them from immediate harm.
○ Gentle discipline, such as removing a toy or redirecting attention, is more effective than harsh
punishment.
○ The goal is to guide behavior rather than suppress creativity.
● Creativity:
○ With creativity there is no reward or punishment from the authority.
○ When they freely decide to try or do something then they create a desire inside them to do it.
○ Give the child space to decide what they want to do. children need space where there are
minimal risks, allowing them to play and explore without strict rules or immediate
consequences.
○ Creativity in children flourishes when they feel safe and free to explore without fear of injury
or significant loss (e.g., health, money, or possessions).
○ Creativity thrives in environments where children are allowed to make their own choices and
follow intrinsic motivation rather than external rewards or punishments.
○ Both discipline and creativity can be developed together by allowing children to experience
minor, controlled consequences (e.g., letting a child climb stairs and feeling the discomfort
before intervening).
○ The environment can also serve as a form of "discipline" when children naturally face the
consequences of their actions in safe, controlled settings.
○ The key is creating a balance between giving children the freedom to explore creatively and
knowing when to introduce structure or discipline for their safety or learning.

4.4 Stimulating the Kids
● Stimulating children who are two years old and below in EL daycares involves engaging children’s
senses, encouraging exploration, and fostering early development.
● Here are some ways to do that:
4.4.1 Sensory Play
4.4.1.1 Textures and Materials
● Introduce a variety of materials such as soft fabrics, sponges, and textured toys,...etc.
● For example; you can create a sensory bin filled with rice, beans, or sand, and hide small toys inside
for them to find.
● This stimulates their sense of touch and helps develop fine motor skills. Rotating the materials keeps
the experience fresh and exciting.
● Provide different sound-making objects like shakers, bells, or drums.
● You can even create instruments using household items like filling plastic bottles with beans or rice.
● Singing familiar songs and rhymes like "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" not only entertains but also
supports early language development.
● Encourage them to mimic the sounds they hear, which helps with auditory discrimination.
4.4.8 Routine and Structure
4.4.8.1 Consistent Routine
● Establish a predictable daily routine that includes time for meals, naps, outdoor play, and structured
activities.
● For example, start the day with a morning circle time where you sing a welcome song and talk about
the day’s activities.
● Consistency in routine helps children feel secure and understand what to expect, reducing anxiety
and tantrums.
EL_CgManual_CURRENT_v016 November 5, 2025

4. CHILD INTERACTION STRATEGIES Page 32 of XX
4.4.8.2 Positive Reinforcement:
● Use positive reinforcement to encourage desired behaviors.
● Praise children when they share toys, follow directions, or complete a task.
● Simple phrases like “Good job!” or “Well done!” along with a smile or clap can significantly boost
their self-esteem and encourage them to continue positive behaviors.
4.4.9 Language Development
4.4.9.1 Talking and Naming:
● Engage in frequent conversation with the children, even if they aren’t fully verbal yet.
○ Describe what they are doing, seeing, or feeling.
○ For example, if they are playing with blocks, you might say, “You’re building a tall tower. I
see a red block right here in the middle.” This interaction helps them associate words with
actions and objects, fostering early language development.
● Leave pauses between conversations so the child can have space to focus and process.
○ Too much constant conversation distracts the child from their independent playful focus.
○ Pauses also give the caregiver space to assess the child’s intention and situation, and plan
strategies for next steps, etc.
4.4.9.2 Simple Commands
● This includes teaching children to follow simple commands like “clap your hands,” “sit down,” or
“touch your nose.”
● Positive aspects and outcomes:
○ ⬆Discipline, ⬇Creativity
■ Develops and practices discipline and respect for caregivers.
■ Helps the child learn to set healthy boundaries on their creativity, helping the child’s
ability to focus.
○ It also aids in language comprehension, developing listening the child’s skills.
EL_CgManual_CURRENT_v016 November 5, 2025

4. CHILD INTERACTION STRATEGIES Page 33 of XX
● Negative aspects and outcomes:
○ Commands will decrease the child’s creative activity. Overuse of commands can make the
child bored and frustrated. Their creativity in daycare spaces may decrease.
● Good practices
○ You can make it fun by turning it into a game or song.
○
●
4.6 Give the child the decision-making power
4.6.1 Self-Ownership→Creativity→Focus→Learning
● If the child decides they want to do some action on their own,
○ then they feel ownership of that action,
○ and they will be creative in their approach,
○ and this creativity will stimulate their mind to focus on exploring the current activity
○ then this focus will cause them to remember and learn!
4.6.2 Authority’s Claim→Discipline→Avoidance
● If an authority figure gives out commands, bribes, and/or punishments about an action, then the child
feels like a foreigner, employee, or trespasser around that action, and they will do less of the action,
as little as possible, just enough to:
○ achieve the rewards, maybe
○ avoid the punishments, maybe
○ and return to their other favorite owned activities.
● Since they are more focused on the rewards, punishments, and preferred other activities, they aren’t
focused on exploring the current activity.
● Thus they don’t remember or learn about the current activity.
EL_CgManual_CURRENT_v016 November 5, 2025

4. CHILD INTERACTION STRATEGIES Page 34 of XX
4.6.3 Let the child decide!
● By letting the child decide, you allow them to stimulate themselves to learn creatively.
● Let them decide:
○ How and where to sit
○ What activity to do
○ What they are interested in
● You can control some aspects of their activity indirectly through:
○ The environment:
■ Placing, removing, and arranging furniture and toys
■ Allowing or removing other children from the room
● Your adult behavior:
○ Children often will naturally imitate your behavior, and be interested in your actions
■ Communication
● Language is very powerful in the child’s mind.
● If you tell an interesting story, but leave the ending blank, the child may want
to find out the ending.
● If you tell a story about something that happened inside a box, but delay
telling the ending, the child may reach for the box to look inside.
● Thus, we can control the childrens’ behavior powerfully, but indirectly,
through stories and songs.
● The caregiver is challenged to manage the children in 6 ways:
○ so that the children have more good behavior
○ guided indirectly by their environment, self-chosen imitation of adult behavior, and
self-chosen interest in the adults’ communication
○ with less rewards and punishments
○ thereby increasing their focus and learning
