**Output**: `03_edited/chapter_08.md`

## Changes Applied

### 1. Story Structure [HIERARCHY]
- **Changed**: Story headings from placeholder text to proper sections
  - `S.1 STORY_TITLE` → `## 8.1 Kidnapping Due to Working Alone`
  - `S.2 STORY_TITLE` → `## 8.2 Overwhelmed Without Help`
  - `S.3 STORY_TITLE` → `## 8.3 Accepting Unconscious Child`
- **Rationale**: Improves document structure and removes placeholder text

### 2. Word Choice [GRAMMAR]
- **Changed**: "After requiring" → "After inquiring"
- **Location**: Story 8.1, paragraph 1
- **Rationale**: "Requiring" doesn't make sense in context; "inquiring" (asking questions) is correct

### 3. Sentence Structure [GRAMMAR]
- **Changed**: "he ordered a cup of water ,the manager went to get him some water" → "he ordered a cup of water. The manager went to get him some water."
- **Location**: Story 8.1, paragraph 1
- **Rationale**: Fixed comma splice and sentence separation

### 4. Pronoun Consistency [GRAMMAR]
- **Changed**: "because he had no one" → "because she had no one"
- **Location**: Story 8.1, paragraph 2
- **Rationale**: Manager is female throughout the story

### 5. Pronoun Consistency [GRAMMAR]
- **Changed**: "came back to his senses" → "came back to her senses"
- **Location**: Story 8.1, paragraph 2
- **Rationale**: Manager is female throughout the story

### 6. Phrasing [GRAMMAR]
- **Changed**: "she had given the children out to strangers" → "she had given the children to a stranger"
- **Location**: Story 8.1, paragraph 2
- **Rationale**: More natural English phrasing; also singular "stranger" is accurate

### 7. Timeline Clarity [CLARITY]
- **Changed**: "while she was taken to the police custody and was jailed for years" → "She was taken into police custody and later jailed for years."
- **Location**: Story 8.1, paragraph 2
- **Rationale**: Clarifies sequence of events; "while" suggested simultaneity incorrectly

### 8. Age Description [GRAMMAR]
- **Changed**: "two new month old crying babies" → "two crying newborn babies"
- **Location**: Story 8.2, paragraph 1
- **Rationale**: "New month old" is unclear; "newborn" is standard term

### 9. Expression [GRAMMAR]
- **Changed**: "I was stressed up" → "I was stressed out"
- **Location**: Story 8.2, paragraph 1
- **Rationale**: "Stressed out" is standard English expression

### 10. Word Choice [GRAMMAR]
- **Changed**: "The day care was in" → "The daycare was in"
- **Location**: Story 8.2, paragraph 1
- **Rationale**: Consistency - "daycare" used elsewhere as one word

### 11. Redundancy [REDUNDANCY]
- **Changed**: "placed the baby to sleep and let him sleep" → "placed the baby to sleep"
- **Location**: Story 8.3, paragraph 1
- **Rationale**: Removed redundant phrase saying the same thing twice

### 12. Gender Consistency [GRAMMAR]
- **Changed**: "bringing her to the daycare" → "bringing him to the daycare"
- **Location**: Story 8.3, paragraph 3
- **Rationale**: Baby referred to as "him" throughout story; made consistent

### 13. Lesson Formatting [FORMATTING]
- **Changed**: `⇒ Lesson text` → `**Lesson:** Lesson text`
- **Location**: All three stories
- **Rationale**: Improved visual hierarchy and markdown formatting

### 14. Chapter Heading [FORMATTING]
