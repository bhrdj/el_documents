## 0.1 INTRODUCTION

Founded in 2023 by Steven Bhardwaj, the company Everything Is Learning (EL) is based in Kenya, with a parent company registered in the USA. EL's operations focus on creating daycare programs. These programs focus on cultivating a nurturing environment, laying essential foundations for early childhood development. The target population for the program is children aged 6 to 36 months. EL provides supportive spaces where young minds thrive and grow.

This manual is based on the pioneering methods of Steven Bhardwaj, Beth Wanyoike, and Naomi Gachanja. It serves as a comprehensive guide for all EL Kenya daycare staff.

[Managers, caregivers, and other staff are urged to study the manual to:

- ˹Guide˺ day-to-day daycare ˹operations˺
- Ensure ˹EL standards˺ are ˹met˺ in every EL daycare]

### EL Core Values

1. The Child
2. Comes First

We do what is best for the child — we care about their safety, happiness, and growth.

3. Caregivers Matter

Caregivers are important. We support and train them to give the best care and learning to children.

4. Play is Powerful

We believe children learn best through play. It helps them think, talk, and feel good about themselves.

5. Use What We Have

We use local materials and simple ideas to teach children in smart and creative ways.

6. Learn and Improve

We check what works through research, listen to feedback, and keep making things better for children.

7. Every Child Deserves a Chance

We work to make sure all children — rich or poor, in towns or villages — get good care and learning.

8. Family and Community Help Children Grow

We work with parents and the community to raise strong, happy, and curious children together.

**[EDITORIAL NOTE: ADJUST CORE VALUES TO SIMPLIFY, AND ALSO ADD IN ASPECTS FOR OUR ADULT TEAMS, TO CONNECT WITH THE "PROVERBS TO GUIDE US" FOR INSTANCE…]**

## 0.3 PROVERBS TO GUIDE US

- Everything is Changing
  - Flexibility in Work
  - Leaving a Manager Role is Not a Demotion
- Constructive Criticism is Respect
  - Respected and advancing team members will feel criticized heavily, as managers know you have the attitude and focus to receive it in a good way, and grow in the company.
  - Novice and struggling team members may receive more appreciation and less criticism, as they are already having enough difficulty meeting basic company expectations.
- Reporting a Mistake is a Success
  - Excellent communication among staff about the difficult challenges we are facing is key to EL's development.
  - Ask any questions that you have.

## 0.4 A NOTE TO DAYCARE MANAGERS AND CAREGIVERS

Dear Everything Is Learning (EL) Daycare Managers and Caregivers,

[At EL daycares, our most important responsibility is to provide ˹exceptional care˺ to each and every child ˹entrusted˺ to us. We prioritize the ˹growth and development˺ of each child. We believe in creating a ˹caring˺ ˹growth environment˺ where ˹order˺, ˹fun learning˺, and ˹safety˺ prevail, and every child's ˹unique˺ ˹needs˺ are ˹valued˺ and ˹supported˺ - from admission to pick-up.]

[This ˹manual˺ sets ˹standards˺ for ˹daycare operations˺ under EL. Our dedicated team conducts scheduled ˹assessments˺ to ˹strictly˺ ensure that ˹the standards are followed˺. In case a daycare has not ˹met˺ part of the ˹standards˺, ˹prompt˺ ˹action˺ will be taken, aiming for ˹continuous improvement˺.

We strongly encourage you and your team to thoroughly ˹review˺ and ˹put into action˺ the manual's ˹guidelines˺, upholding the ˹high standards˺ of EL daycares.]

Best Regards,

Steven Bhardwaj
Director, Everything Is Learning
