# CHAPTER 8: CAREGIVER CHALLENGE STORIES

## 8.1 Kidnapping Due to Working Alone

My fellow manager used to work alone in the daycare, without a helper. One day a stranger came into the daycare and pretended to be a new parent looking for a daycare. After inquiring, he ordered a cup of water. The manager went to get him some water. Sooner than later, the manager could not tell what happened because she found herself releasing the children one by one and giving them out to the stranger. Later the stranger took them to the car, which was parked outside and drove off. With two kids.

Afterwards the manager came back to her senses and realized, she had given the children to a stranger. She found herself in a dilemma not knowing what to do because she had no one to leave the children with. Luckily for her, she had a good neighbor who came to help. Afterwards she went to report the case to the police. She was taken into police custody and later jailed for years. It was later discovered, the manager was drugged and the children kidnapped.

**Lesson:** Never work alone in the daycare.

## 8.2 Overwhelmed Without Help

During my early days of working in the daycare, I used to work alone without a helper. One day, I found myself having ten kids in the daycare and two crying newborn babies. I was stressed out not knowing what to do. The daycare was in a big mess because I could not manage them by myself. I was so confused, there was so much complaining from the parents, I even forgot to change some of the young children's diapers and even feeding them was a problem. I had a very bad day which I will never forget.

**Lesson:** Never work alone in the daycare. Always have somebody to help.

## 8.3 Accepting Unconscious Child

Let me tell you about a friend of mine, who ran a daycare in Kasarani. One morning, a mother dropped off her baby very early, asking the manager to put him straight to bed so he wouldn't wake up. The manager, trying to follow the mother's wishes, placed the baby to sleep.

A few hours later, the manager noticed the baby was still sleeping and began to worry—he wasn't usually this quiet. When she checked on him, she was devastated to find that the baby had passed away. Panicked, she tried calling the mother, but there was no answer. She took the baby to the nearest hospital, where the doctor confirmed the heartbreaking news: the baby had died. The doctor then suggested she report the incident to the police.

At the police station, the manager explained what happened, and they helped track down the mother. When she arrived, she acted surprised and confused. The investigation revealed that the mother had given the baby an overdose of medication before bringing him to the daycare which caused his death.

The manager was arrested and later sentenced to prison. This tragic event taught everyone a crucial lesson about safety and responsibility.

**Lesson:** On-arrival, make sure each child is safe and fully awake, even if the parent asks you to put a child straight to bed.
