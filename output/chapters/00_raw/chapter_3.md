3.0 General discussion
● Absolutely, discussing general safety and hygiene is crucial for maintaining health and preventing
accidents or illnesses in daycare.
● Here are some broad subjects to consider like Food and drink, Daycare visitors and
neighbors,Environment hazards within daycare and Activity hazards within daycare.
● Each of these areas contributes to a holistic approach to safety and hygiene, impacting not only child
& Staff’s health but also the well-being of our community.
3.1 Daycare Visitors and Neighbors
● Managing visitors and neighbors in a daycare setting is crucial for the safety and well-being of
children. Here are some effective strategies:
○ Make sure the building gates and hallway gates are closed, especially while the kids are
outside playing.
○ Always make sure exits are clear, known, and well-marked in case of emergencies.
○ Fence the daycare effectively so that when kids are playing none from outside shall insecure
them.
○ Inspect regularly inventory book to approve what is available,broken, missed,needed,..etc
○ Repair automatically anything broken to avoid any accident.
○ Make sure doors are closed effectively when the day is closed.
○ Make sure the daycare’s bell is not bothering the surroundings.
3.2 Environmental hazards Within Daycare
● Environmental hazards in daycare can vary widely but often include factors that can impact a kid's
health, safety, and E.l productivity.
EL_CgManual_CURRENT_v016 November 5, 2025

3. SAFETY AND HYGIENE Page 3 of XX
● Staff must recognize and address these hazards in order to create a safe and comfortable daily care
work environment for the kids and anybody else in the daycare.
● Here below in our daycare we have some of common environmental hazards:
3.2.1 Physical Hazards
● Never leave uncovered buckets of water.
● Always keep sharp objects out of reach of the kids.
● Never leave exposed electrical wires, or open socket-boxes.
● Never allow a kid to walk on Unprotected stairways alone.
● Always prevent kids from having access to heavy furnitures or daycare items that can tip over like;
bookshelves,shoe rack,chairs, tables, large toys,..etc
● Do not expose any electrical outlets, cords, and appliances.
● Put away Chords / simple ropes ,necklaces, or anything that can wrap around a kid's neck.
● Try to move away all small objects that kid can put in their mouths, such as; stones, buttons, or
small toy parts,..etc
3.2.2 Kitchen hazards
● Hazards include:
○ Knives and other sharp utensils that can stab and cut
○ Hot stoves and hot sufurias that can cause burns
○ Explosive cooking gas with an easy-to-open gas knob on the cooker
○ Poisons like pesticides and cleaning chemicals
○ Enticing foodstuffs like mandazi and sugar which may attract a child to a dangerous behavior
in the kitchen
○ Heavy jericans and basins with water that can be falling and crushing hazards.
EL_CgManual_CURRENT_v016 November 5, 2025

3. SAFETY AND HYGIENE Page 4 of XX
○ Large basins can present a drowning hazard.
○ A child may try to climb onto a kitchen table or sink, especially to reach enticing food,
causing a fall hazard.
○ Multiple different hazards can combine to become a more serious combined hazard.
● Good practices:
○ Keep the kitchen organized and the door closed, to prevent hazards to staff and children.
○ Caregivers should be vigilant to keep children in a good habit of never visiting the kitchen
casually or alone.
○ Activities like encouraging children to independently throw away rubbish, should use a
dustbin in a separate location, for instance.
3.2.3 Office hazards
● The office contains dangerous items, so offices should be kept closed to children whenever the
supplies are not well closed-away. Dangerous items include:
○ Metallic and sharp hazards like hammers, nails, scissors, pencil sharpeners, razors, etc.
○ Poisonous liquids like chemicals, ink, glues, etc.
○ Heavy, fragile, and expensive machines like the laminator machine, laptop computers, printer,
phones
○ Easily wasted and damaged items like A4 paper, pencils, pens, markers, rubbers, books, etc.
○ Important paperwork and documents that should be kept well-arranged and must not be
misplaced or damaged.
● Good practices:
○ All office supplies in the daycare environment such as staplers, whiteboard markers, ink
should not be accessed from by children from where they are stored.

3.4 Fire Safety and uses of CO fire extinguishers in the daycare.
2
3.4.1 What are the possible kinds of fire that might happen in our daycares and offices?
● Kitchen fires:
○ Cooking gas
■ Cooking gas fires are caused by gas leaks. Leaks can be caused by:
● faulty gas burners
● rusted gas cylinders
● badly connected hosepipes
○ Cooking oil
■ These fires happen when oil becomes too hot, starts to smoke, and then catches fire.
○ Children playing with matchboxes and lighters
EL_CgManual_CURRENT_v016 November 5, 2025

3. SAFETY AND HYGIENE Page 13 of XX
● Electrical fires
○ Fires caused by sockets, wires, or bulbs
■ If too many machines are connected to a socket, the socket can overload.
■ Loose connections and incorrect wiring can make electricity jump and spark.
■ Faulty bulbs and other electrical parts can get too hot.
○ Fires caused by laptops or phones
■ Charging laptop or phone batteries on your bed, on soft fabric, or in an enclosed
container is dangerous.
■ These may build up heat by stopping heat from escaping.
■ Overheated electronics may start a fire.
● General fire
○ Fire that has caught and spread through the building, burning furniture, roofs, etc.
3.4.2 Preventing fires:
● Preventing Kitchen Fires
○ Don't leave cooking gas on when you are not around watching the food.
○ Keep away any item that can catch fire for example a leso, dishes from the top of the gas.
○ Always fully check the gas cylinder at the time of delivery:
■ The hose pipes are well connected.
■ The burners are not bad or leaking any gas.
■ The gas cylinder is not rusted.
● Preventing Electrical Fires:
○ Turn off all electrical items
○ Do not connect too many parts on a socket.

3.4.3 Basics of fire response in the daycare
Fire blanket
■ How it works:
● Lay the fire blanket slowly over the fire.
● Do not throw the fire blanket at the far side of the fire as the flames may jump
up onto your hands and cause harm.
● Then turn off the source of heat and leave the fire blanket over the heat for
about 15 minutes or until the heat has stopped.
■ How to use it in-general:
● Fire blankets can be used to put off:
○ Oil fire
○ Gas fire
○ Electric fire
CO fire extinguisher
2
■ How it works
● Approach the CO fire extinguisher while standing at a safe distance from the
2
fire and discharge the CO fire extinguisher within its effective range using the
2
PASS technique:
○ P- pull - pull the pin as this will break the tamper seal.
EL_CgManual_CURRENT_v016 November 5, 2025

3. SAFETY AND HYGIENE Page 15 of XX
○ A- aim - aim low pointing the horn of the fire extinguisher at the base
of the fire. Don't hold the horn of the fire extinguisher as it is very cold
and may cause harm.
○ S- squeeze - squeeze the CO fire extinguisher handle to let off the
2
extinguishing agent
○ S- sweep - sweep from side to side with the fire extinguisher horn
pointing at the base of the fire until the fire is put off.
●
■ How to use it in-general
● To put off:Electric fire
○ Gas fire
○ Oil fire
○ Grease fire
■ NOTE Do not use CO2 extinguishers in small rooms as CO2 gas is poisonous at only
4% concentration and can kill at just 8% concentration.
■ Do not use water to put off electric fire as water is a good conductor of electricity and
can harm the person trying to put off the fire.
3.4.4 Response to fire outbreak:
● First steps for any fire response:
○ Shout, “Fire! Fire!” to alert others.
○ Call the fire department at 999 if necessary.
○ Plan a safe evacuation path before getting close to the fire. Don't let the fire, smoke or heat
come between you and your evacuation path.
● When should you try to extinguish a fire?
EL_CgManual_CURRENT_v016 November 5, 2025

3. SAFETY AND HYGIENE Page 16 of XX
○ When the fire is small
○ When the exit path is clear of smoke and the rooms visibility is good
○ When the room is not hot due to heat radiating from the fire
● When should you evacuate?
○ When smoke has blocked your path and the visibility in the room is not clear
○ When there is a lot of heat in the room
○ When the fire has grown big and you cannot access it with the CO fire extinguisher
2
● How should you evacuate?
○ Safely stop your work immediately.
○ Shut down fire-hazard equipment including: laptops, cooking gas, electric circuit breakers.
○ Leave the building or room through the exit path.
○ As you evacuate try and close doors and windows behind you as this will help prevent the
fire spreading to the other rooms fast.
○ When evacuating, ensure the room you are leaving no one is left behind.
○ If an exit path becomes smoky or a huge fire find a clear and safe exit path while walking do
not run.
○ Immediately after you have evacuated the building, move far away from the building and exit
doors.
○ Do not re-enter the building until it is authorized by fire department personnel that it is clear
○
