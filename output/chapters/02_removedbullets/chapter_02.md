## 2.1 DIAPER CHANGING

### 2.1.1 Timing and Records

- Diapered children are checked at least hourly for the need of diaper change. Children under 12
months are checked more frequently.

- After every diaper change, a mark should be put on the Diaper data collection Sheet.
- The data collected through the diaper change tracking sheet will inform potty Training.

### 2.1.2 Location

- Diaper changing should be done on a clean surface, at a designated area. Designated areas include:
  - A clean floor in a non-crowded indoor room of the daycare, on top of a clean diaper-changing
mat.

  - The diaper-changing mat is a piece of mat wrapped with smooth marking tosh material.

### 2.1.3 Preliminary Checks

#### 2.1.3.1 Importance of Quality Diaper Changes

- Everything Is Learning company prioritizes hygiene and prompt diaper changing for the well-being
of our children.

- A caregiver is responsible for ensuring proper diaper changing procedures, habits, and prompt
changes to uphold the health and safety of the children in the day care.

#### 2.1.3.2 Before engaging in the diaper changing activity

- Check!
  - Check the diaper to confirm that the child needs a diaper change.
  - Check on the register about whether the child is supposed to receive diaper-rash cream or
other products.

  - Check the environment to confirm that the chosen location is ready, and that there will be no
urgent interruptions for the diaper change.

- Get!
  - Get the needed supplies and place them on the diaper changing mat for easy transport.
  - The needed supplies include:
    - Daycare diaper supplies bag.
    - The child’s diaper supplies bag.
- Always use the diaper packed for the child to avoid cases of allergies.
    - The diaper changing mat.
- Check that the mat is clean before bringing the child.
    - EL materials like flashcards as-relevant.
- Invite!
  - Have a conversation on diaper change with the child in advance (even for infants).
  - Include the following details:
    - It’s time for a diaper change.
    - Where the diaper change will occur.
    - Listen for feedback from the child (even for infants).
    - Mention any EL activities planned during the diaper change.

#### 2.1.3.3 During the diaper change

- Maintain an attentive conversation with the child throughout. If possible, avoid conversations with
other staff or children in the daycare.

- Steps:
  - Make the baby lie on their back.
  - Use a wipe to clean her/his back and entire genital area(private parts).
  - Start from the cleaner areas with the wet-wipe, and proceed to the dirtier areas.
  - Make sure you fold the used diaper properly, with all soiled wet-wipes inside if-possible.

#### 2.1.3.4 Diaper changing is fun!

- Staff should be calm, and use the opportunity to bond with the child.
- If the child is also calm, the staff can converse and listen to the child, even for an infant. It’s okay to
pause the process briefly sometimes to listen intently to the child’s responses.

- It’s a good time for silly short stories or jokes. One or two related flashcards can be shown, although
they should be discarded or wiped with wipes or soapy water afterwards.

  - The stories, jokes, and word-cards may be related to diaper-changing!

#### 2.1.3.5 After the diaper change

- Steps:
  - Dress the child fully in their clothes.
  - Verbally discuss each part of the dressing process and invite their assistance.
  - Ask them to move off the changing mat. If they respond and try to do this on their own, wait
and encourage them for up-to 10 seconds before helping them. If they don’t respond after 5
seconds, help them to move off the mat.

  - Discuss with the child that you will go to dispose of the diaper, and mention a plan for their
next activity. If they respond, you can continue to listen to their response patiently for up-to

# 10 seconds before excusing yourself. If they don’t respond after 5 seconds, excuse yourself.

  - Ensure the used diapers are disposed appropriately in a covered dustbin.
  - Return to the child and proceed to the next activity.

## 2.2 TOILETING

### 2.2.1 Importance of Toileting

- Everything Is Learning company emphasizes the importance of proper toileting habits and hygiene
practices for the well-being of our children.

- We encourage responsible care to prevent any potential infections, and appreciate commitment to
maintaining a healthy environment.

### 2.2.2 Asking non-diapered children if they need to use the potty

- For children undergoing potty training, prompting should be done after every ten minutes.
- Ask each child once during the 30 minutes before each snack/meal.
- Ask each child once during the 30 minutes after each snack/meal.
- If a child seems distracted despite being interested in an activity, or walking in a strange way, ask
them if they need to use the potty.

### 2.2.3 Using the potty

- Every child should use his or her own potty at each particular time.
- Assist younger children to sit on the potty.
- Children should be trained to wipe him/herself using toilet paper after using the potty.
  - Girls should always be trained to wipe themselves even if it is a short call.
  - Boys should be trained to wipe themselves only for long calls.
- Staff should ensure the wiping is excellently done.
  - If the child had a long call and did not wipe, or wiped imperfectly, make sure you wipe
him/her excellently. You can:

    - Use some warm water/wet wipes to clean his back.
    - Then change his/her clothes to avoid bad smell/ infections.
  - If a girl had a short call and did not wipe:
    - Make sure you wipe her.
    - Train her to always do it by herself.
- Train the kids to do handwashing independently after toileting.

### 2.2.4 Potty Training Guidelines


#### 2.2.4.1 Don’t underestimate the challenge of potty training

- Potty training in El daycares involves coordination between caregivers and parents, patience, and
consistency.

#### 2.2.4.2 Before beginning the potty training process

- Coordinate with Parents
  - Talk to the parents to understand their approach to potty training at home.
  - Consistency between home and daycare is very important.
- Ensure the child shows signs of readiness, such as:
  - Staying dry for longer periods.
  - Showing interest in using the potty.
  - Refusing to wear diapers.
  - Understanding basic instructions.

#### 2.2.4.3 Step-by-step guide

- Create a Routine:
  - Take the child to the potty at regular intervals, such as every 30 minutes, after meals, or after
naps.

  - Use the same words and phrases for potty-related activities (like what we do at handwashing)
and also encourage the parents to do it at home.

- Prepare the Environment:
  - Ensure the potty area is accessible by making sure the potties are always clean and empty.
  - Always make sure the potty area is clean and dry for good hygiene.
  - Make sure the potties are enough depending on the number of children.
- Encourage Independence:
  -
  - Encourage the child to pull up and down their pants by themselves.
  - Show the child how to:
    - Place the potty properly while sitting.
    - Wipe properly.
    - Wash their hands.
  - Big celebration when the child uses the potty on their own,
    - No matter how much caregiver effort was required!
- Handle Accidents Calmly:
  - Encourage the child with positive reinforcement every time they try to use the potty, even
when they aren’t successful.

  - Never scold or punish the child for accidents. Remain patient and supportive.
  - Accidents are a normal part of potty training. Reassure the child and clean up without making
unnecessary concern.

  - Keep extra clothes at the daycare and encourage parents to do the same.
- Transition to Underwear:
  - Gradually transition the child from diapers to underwear as they become more consistent with
using the potty.

- Follow Up:
  - Keep parents informed about their child's progress and any challenges.
  - Continue the routine until the child is fully potty trained.
  - Reinforce the behavior consistently.

### 2.2.5 Emptying and cleaning potties and toilets

- Potties
  - Dump the contents of the potty into the toilet and rinse the potty with water.
  - If there are remaining sticky feces:
    - Loosen them with the toilet brush.
    - Then pour water over the toilet brush into the potty and twist the brush in the potty to
clean the brush.

    - Replace the toilet brush and dump the water.
  - Mop the floor under all potties, wipe the bottom otherwise-clean potties on the top of the
mop.

  - Pour about 50mL of detergent solution and rinse the potty with water.
  - Wipe dry with the Potty Drying Towel. Replace the potty and all cleaning tools.
  - Staff need to clean potties immediately after use.
- Toilets
  - Flush the toilet with
    - The flush handle if available,
    - Or by pouring in ~1 liter of
- Reused sink/mopping water or rain-tank water if available or normal tap water.
- Using a small bucket.
  - Clean remaining sticky feces the same way as with potties.
  - If there is a mess or excessive smell, give the toilet an additional thorough cleaning.

### 2.2.6 Inventory, preparing, and storing the potty-cleaning tools

- Sufficient potties:
  - Ensure there is at least one potty for every three non-diapered children.
  - For example: If there are 12 non-diapered children, there should be at least 4 potties.

## 2.3 HANDWASHING

### 2.3.1 Strategy and frequency

- Hand washing should be fun!
  - At every moment when we do handwashing, children are learning how to handwash
independently.

  - We are patient with their independent efforts in handwashing, even if we could save water
and time by helping them more.

  - We do handwashing before-and-after every meal, after outdoor activities and after toileting.

### 2.3.2 How to wash hands

- Turn the faucet on to wet both hands.
- Rub the soap with both hands to make your hands soapy.
- Scrub palms together, and scrub with fingers laced to distribute soap over hands.
- Scrub palms together, and scrub with fingers laced to rinse soap off hands.
- Scrub until soap is fully washed-off.
- Turn the faucet off.

### 2.3.3 Group handwashing

- Before meals, arrange all children in a queue.
- One by one, allow them to wash hands independently. Help as necessary.
- Use hand washing songs for motivation and language development.

### 2.3.4 Handwashing furnishings

- Make sure hand washing stations are accessible to all children.
- A bar of soap should be placed nearby the water dispenser and catch-basin.
- Write frequently-used hand washing songs and words on A3 size paper, laminate, and hang on the
wall for reference by children and staff.

- For children that are not yet able to use the faucet:
  - A caregiver should be at the handwashing station before the child arrives.

## 2.4 Meals

### 2.4.1 Meals strategy and overview

#### 2.4.1.1 Meals served in the daycare:

- Breakfast (10 AM)
- Lunch (12 Noon)
- Evening Snacks (4 PM)

#### 2.4.1.2 Communication

- Maintain open communication with parents regarding their child's eating habits, allergies, and
preferences.

- Advise parents to provide diverse foods and textures to promote interest of the child in eating, and a
well-rounded nutritious diet.

- Collaborate with parents to provide a seamless transition between home and daycare meals.

#### 2.4.1.3 Daycare-furnished meals:

- Our current Kahawa West daycares are mostly re-warming food individually prepared by parents for
their children, and that’s okay.

- For future daycares, we will advise parents more emphatically to pay for daycare-prepared meals, to
ensure consistency and nutritional value, as spoiled food may pose health risks to children.

- Consult with your daycare manager for a meal schedule.

#### 2.4.1.4 Training

- Provide ongoing training for staff on meal preparation, nutrition, and food safety.
- Stay updated on best practices to continually enhance the quality of meals provided.

### 2.4.2 Meal Preparation

#### 2.4.2.1 Allergies

- A child should never be served with anything they are allergic to.
- Maintain a table of children's allergies, including milk, sugar, wheat, and eggs.
  - Keep the allergies table up-to-date as an electronic record (link??), and also printed and
pasted on the wall in the kitchen.

- Always double-check the allergies table before meal preparation and service.
- If a child’s family has reported allergies:
  - Carefully prevent allergy contamination of food when rewarming their lunch in sufurias.
  - Either warm the allergic child’s food first, or wash the sufuria with soapy water and rinse
before warming their food.

#### 2.4.2.2 Checking food supplied by parents

- Make sure each child’s food container is well-labeled with the child’s name.
  - Most containers have two pieces, like a bowl and a lid, and both pieces should be separately
labeled.

  - Labels go on the side or the top of a dish, not on the underside of the dish.
- Check the status of the child’s food!
  - Check parent-supplied meals for spoilage before warming or serving the food.
  - In the case where a child's packed food is spoiled, contact the daycare manager for guidance.
  - Never serve a child spoiled food under any circumstances.
  - Never serve cold meals to children.
  - Always ensure that cooked meals are re-warmed before feeding.
  - Fresh fruit should be washed before serving.
- When feeding, always make sure you take a portion of food, leaving the rest of the food kept safely.
In case the child did not finish his/her food, make sure you inform the parent in the evening.

  - If you are using sufuria to warm, make sure you wash it in between to avoid mixing.
  - For those who have their food in the hot dishes, open the dish for some time to allow the food
to cool to the right temperature.

#### 2.4.2.3 Kitchen hygiene and food safety

##### 2.4.2.3.1 Preventing food contamination

- Wear a hair covering.
- Wash hands frequently and before touching food. Maintain clean hands.
- Don’t use food that has fallen on the table or other unclean surfaces.
- Make sure you wear an apron when preparing food.
- Make sure all your nails are well cut and clean.
- Make sure you maintain personal body hygiene.
- Wear a face mask every time you have the flu, cough,...etc
- Have a clean sponge/cloth to wipe your face if you are sweating.
- Prepare food before cooking. e.g, peeling, washing, etc

- Always keep your workspace clean and organized.
- Always wash dishcloths, sponges, and kitchen towels in hot water to prevent the spread of bacteria.

#### 2.4.2.4 Kitchen cleanliness

- Wash dishes on an ongoing basis.
  - Avoid leaving dirty dishes in the sink for more than 10 minutes.
- After preparing food, sweep and mop the floor, and empty the rubbish bin, without delay.
  - This helps avoid attracting vermin and transporting food debris from the kitchen into the
daycare.

- Always lock the kitchen door to prevent children from accessing it, reducing the risk of accidents.

#### 2.4.2.5 Utensils and serving of meals

##### 2.4.2.5.1 Labeling utensils

- Before serving, check that each dish and cup is labeled with the child’s name with masking tape to
ensure accurate serving and prevent mix-ups.

- Remove unused masking tape from utensils for children absent for more than one week.
- Keep records of meals.
- Arrange the children’s meals in the kitchen, prepared & labeled, before bringing them out to the
children.

- Take a picture of the arrangement with the labels showing, as a record of the meal and portion size.
- Separate meal rooms for older and younger children.
- Feed the younger children in a different room.
- Prioritize the safety of children during mealtime.
  - Ensure that meals are at an appropriate temperature, and cut into appropriately sized pieces to
prevent choking hazards.

  - Closely supervise infants during feeding.
- Begin washing the sufurias and cleaning the kitchen as soon as the meals are being served.

#### 2.4.2.6 Encouraging good manners during meals

- Use positive encouragement to help children behave well during meals.
  - Use statements such as “Finish chewing and swallowing all the food before talking,” instead
of, “No talking with food in your mouth!”

- Focus on simple good-manners behaviors, like “Use your spoon,” and “Keep all the rice on your
plate!”

- Try imaginative stories, like: “The rice is a herd of antelope, the plate is the open plains, and you’re
the alpha in a pride of lions.

- Don’t let any antelopes escape until all your lions have finished their meals!”
- Focus on clear communication, and clear consequences when necessary.
- If and when negative discipline is necessary, use a supportive framework.

#### 2.4.2.7 Enrichment activities before and during meals

- Begin each meal by leading children in a prayer using songs or passages in a language they can
understand.

##### 2.4.2.7.1 Here are storytelling tips.

- Observe table manners.
- By combining storytelling with the practice of table manners, you create a structured yet engaging
environment where children can learn and reinforce positive behaviors during mealtime, and at the
same time, enjoy and finish their food.

- Choose a mealtime-themed story like "The Very Hungry Caterpillar.
- Before lunch begins, gather the children and briefly introduce the chosen story. Explain that the
characters in the story practice good manners, just as they should during their meal.

- Start telling the story as the children begin eating.
- Narrate the story in short, engaging segments, pausing occasionally to observe and encourage proper
table manners, such as using a spoon correctly, chewing with mouth closed, swallowing first before
talking, or saying "please" and "thank you."

- Throughout the meal, consistently reinforce good table manners by linking them back to the story.
For example, "The caterpillar chewed slowly to enjoy his food—let’s all try to chew and swallow
slowly like him."

- After the meal, gather the children to conclude the story.
  - Discuss the lessons learned, such as the importance of sharing or eating mindfully, and how
the children’s behavior reflected the characters' good manners.

- Praise and acknowledge the children for their good manners during the meal, reinforcing the
connection between the story and their actions.

- For instance, "You all showed excellent manners today, just like the characters in our story."

#### 2.4.2.8 “Menu” card game.

- This card game not only makes lunch more engaging but also serves as an educational tool for food
recognition and healthy eating.

- While children are eating, display meal-related flashcards. (see section 5.1.3.c)

#### 2.4.2.9 Responsive Feeding

- Responsive Feeding is an approach where caregivers adapt to a child's cues and needs during meals,
fostering a healthy and supportive eating environment.

- Promote independent feeding among children, particularly the older ones.
- For children who are learning how to do independent feeding, encourage them to feed themselves
even if it gets messy.

  - But, do assist with feeding enough to ensure they are well-fed.
  - Independent feeding is the end-goal of responsive feeding.
- Caregivers may offer food or snacks to a child displaying signs of hunger, such as crying, reaching
for food, chewing clothes, or sucking fingers.

- A caregiver should stop feeding a baby when they've eaten enough.
  - Notice signs of fullness like closed mouth, turning away, or holding food without swallowing.
  - Don’t wait for the child to vomit to indicate fullness!
- Encourage children to eat during meals by cheering and clapping when they swallow, feeding all
babies simultaneously, and conversing with them while eating.

  - Avoid distractions like toys.
- Avoid feeding a child when he/she is tired or sleepy.

## 2.5 After meal

### 2.5.1 Individual child’s hygiene

- Train the kids to do handwashing independently after every meal.
- Make sure each kid’s face is wiped or washed as appropriate.
- Make sure none of the kids are eating the spilled food on the floor.
- Clothing soiled with spilled food, should be changed with clean, dry clothing.

### 2.5.2 Child’s special meal items

- For children under medication, administer the medication after meals unless directed otherwise.
- After each child has finished their meal, wash, wipe, and neatly repack their food containers back
into their bag.

### 2.5.3 Carpets, Potties, Dishes, floors.

- Sweep carpets after every meal.

## 2.6 Watching children

- Detailed methods for watching and caring for children are found in other sections of this manual.
- This section briefly explains our system for making sure that “someone is there” for the child, that no
child is being neglected at any point during the day.

### 2.6.1 Safety & hygiene is a task for all staff

- All staff, regardless of their other daily tasks, should be vigilant and proactive in
  - ensuring children’s safety
  - ensuring their continuous opportunities for healthy development.
- The daycare may have many staff, many rooms, and a large outdoor play-space in each daycare. This
array of spaces:

  - enables attentive small-group sessions during the day.
- The large space leaves some spaces unattended, when staff are concentrated together. Unattended
spaces are inappropriate for daycare children.

- All staff are responsible to continuously check for:
  - secure management of doors and risky materials
  - secure management of valuables
  - supervision of children
  - developing good safety habits
- Children’s safety habits are just as important and effective in ensuring their safety, as securing their
environment.

- Doors should be kept open, secured, and/or locked according to the appropriate need.
- Allocate staff based on staff-to-child ratios according to age groups. (Refer to the admission policy
for specific age groups in the appendix.)

- Children must be under continuous supervision at all times, including during self-directed activities,
nap time, meals, and outdoor activities.

- A staff member should never leave children assigned to them unattended at any given time
- Staff should consistently create an engaging environment for children by actively participating in
their play, capturing their interest in activities or objects, and flashing EL flashcards related to their
interests.

- Staff should take the initiative to create flashcards with vocabulary related to the child’s interests.

### 2.6.2 Transporting children from one daycare to the other

#### 2.6.2.1 Human transport

- Carry the child on your back if the child has not yet learnt how to walk.
- If the child can walk, hold the child’s hand and walk to the destination.
  - Walking is a good exercise for the child.
  - The ratio for this activity should be a maximum of 1 caregiver to 2 children.
- Hold each child by hand when walking on the streets.
- Use the pace of the child. Do not make the child run or strain when walking.
- It is your responsibility as a caregiver to ensure the safety and wellbeing of the child during
transportation.

- Help the child to cross roads and navigate through obstacles on the way.
- Take the trip as a learning opportunity for the child.
- In the case the child is extremely tired or sick, carry the child on your back.
- Do not walk with the child when there is too much sunlight.

#### 2.6.2.2 Motorcycle

- A good experienced motorcycle rider should be chosen for the transportation
- The motorcycle should be in good condition.

#### 2.6.2.3 Car

## 2.7 Discussion on different daycare staff-children ratio

### 2.7.1 Comparing daycare caregivers: children ratios

- Minimum ratios require a minimum number of caregivers to care for a given number of children in a
daycare. ensure individual attention and a nurturing environment

  - Informal daycares in Kahawa West often operate with 1 caregiver alone with 10 kids, or 2
caregivers with 20+ kids.

  - Tiny Totos advises a minimum ratio of 1 caregiver for 7.5 children. That means at least 2
caregivers if the daycare has anywhere between 8 and 15 kids.

  - EL partner daycares must always maintain at least a 1:5 ratio at all times.
  - Bethsaida Daycare in 2025 is operating with a 1:3 minimum ratio for caregivers in the
daycare.

- It implies that, if there are 10 children in the daycare, then there are 2 staff to care for them.
- This commitment reflects our dedication to delivering top-tier care, prioritizing our children’s
well-being, and ensuring the safety of every child in the center.

- Most daycares in Kenya and the EAC region operate at a ratio of 1:10.
- This is true even for daycares with high fees.
- EL believes that a higher staff: kids ratio is one of the most important things in increasing the quality
of a daycare.

- Maybe daycares and families in this region haven’t yet or been convinced of, or learned about, this
idea.

### 2.7.2 Ratio of (2:5)

- A ratio of 2:5 is twice as many staff as a ratio of 1:5.
- During the current year of 2025, EL is keeping the ratio between 1:1 and 1:2..
- This means 2 staff for every 5 children.
- That is, 4 staff in a daycare of 10 children.
- The purpose of doubling our staff to the 1:2.5 ratio is:
  - To allow increased attention to the development of our daycare systems.
  - We are especially focused on staff training and documentation.
  - The resulting improvements in all our systems will be the foundation of future growth of the
EL company.
