RELOCATIONS, ADDITIONS:

RELOCATIONS, ADDITIONS:
NEED TO ADD
Uniforms for Children and Caregivers
Caregiver Aprons

- Wear your aprons at all times in the daycares and offices.
- Everyone make sure that your name-card is placed in the name slot at all times, written in large red marker.
- Use a normal A4 paper folded-to-size if you don't have a laminated one yet.
- Caregiver's name should be written on the inside neckline hem of their apron in permanent marker.
- Each staff member is responsible to maintain the stitching, and wash their own aprons individually, on their
own time (or pullout time). The aprons should be clean, dry, and presentable at the start of each working
day.
Caregiver Clogs
* Each caregiver should have their own labeled clogs for use within the daycare only.
* Each caregiver is responsible to keep their clogs clean, and wash them at least twice per week.
* Guest clogs should also be labeled clearly.
Childrens' Aprons

- All children in the daycare should be wearing aprons during many periods of the day, especially meals.
(Unless they are very new to the daycare and wearing the apron is somehow disturbing them.)

- Childrens' aprons are washed and maintained by staff on daycare hours toward the end of the day so they
can be used again the next day.

- We should have 30 childrens' aprons of different relevant sizes.
- After the parents' meeting, the aprons will be embroidered with each child's "codename".
- Purchase order for remaining needed aprons should go out by end of day Monday Mar 31.

Childrens' Clogs

- All childrens' footwear kept on the common shoe-racks should be labeled with permanent marker or with
masking tape, according to the preference of the parents.
NEED TO RELOCATE?

### 4.0.4 Strategies

- Each child develops at their own pace, and it’s important for caregivers to provide a supportive and
stimulating environment that encourages growth in all areas.

- Play, interaction, and positive reinforcement are essential for nurturing well-rounded development.
- Everything Is Learning (EL) techniques play a crucial role in fostering holistic development in
children by addressing their cognitive, social-emotional, physical, and language growth.

- These methods, such as play-based learning, pre-speech reading activities, hands-on exploration,
engage children in a variety of sensory experiences that stimulate brain development.

- Through structured and unstructured play, children enhance problem-solving skills, improve
coordination, and develop social competencies like cooperation and empathy.

- EL techniques also support emotional regulation and resilience as children navigate challenges in a
supportive environment.

- Moreover, language-rich activities help build foundational literacy and communication skills,
ensuring children are better prepared for formal education and life beyond the daycare setting.

- The following sections will discuss some of the EL techniques giving a guideline on how to
implement them.

## 4.5 Shifting Rooms Between Periods

### 4.5.1 Ndege Class


- Enrichment during transition activities in the daycare can help children move smoothly from one
part of their day to the next, making those in-between moments more engaging and less chaotic.

- Here are some proper enrichment activities to consider:

#### 4.5.1.1 Interactive Songs and Rhymes.

- Singing familiar songs or rhymes can capture the kids' attention and make transitions fun.
- Example: Sing "If You're Happy and You Know It" while moving from playtime to snack time,
Jonnie! Jonnie! Yes papa! eating sugar? No papa! when you want them to keep quiet.

#### 4.5.1.2 Storytime with Props

- A quick, engaging story with props can settle children down as they transition from a high-energy
activity.

- Use a puppet or stuffed animal to tell a short story as the kids gather for circle time.

#### 4.5.1.3 Simple Simon Says

- A quick game of "Simon Says" can help children focus and follow directions, easing the transition.
- Example:
  - “Simon says touch your toes” or “Simon says line up by the door,”

#### 4.5.1.4 Calming Breathing Exercises

- This helps children calm down and prepare mentally for the next activity.
- Example:
  - Ask them to take deep breaths in and out while pretending to blow out birthday candles.

#### 4.5.1.5 Movement Breaks

- A brief movement activity, like stretching or jumping, can help children burn off extra energy before
moving to a quieter task.

- Example:
  - “Let’s hop like a frog to the toilet.”

#### 4.5.1.6 Transition Objects


- Carrying a small object (a toy or their session plan basket while going for the small group) can make
the transition more personal and engaging.

- Example:
  - Give each child something to carry as they move from one room to another.

#### 4.5.1.7 Question of the Day

- Engages children in thinking and conversation as they move to the next activity.
- Example:
  - Ask, “What’s your favorite color?” as they get ready for lunch.

#### 4.5.1.8 Sensory Transition Activities

- It may help to use something that appeals to the senses, like touch or smell, to help the children calm
down and get ready for the next activity.

- Example:
  - Before nap time, you might rub a little scented lotion on their hands and say, “Let’s all smell the nice
lotion and rub it on our hands.

- Now we’re ready to sleep!” This may help them relax and get ready for quiet time.

### 4.5.2 Gari class

Here’s a more detailed and simplified explanation of each activity for “gari class” to make it easy to
understand and enjoy during transitioning.

#### 4.5.2.1 Singing Songs

Singing simple, repetitive songs helps capture the children's attention and makes transitions smoother.
Choose familiar songs like “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star” or “The Wheels on the Bus.” As you sing, use
hand motions to make the song interactive. For example, while singing “The Wheels on the Bus,” show
them how to move their hands in a circle for the wheels. As you guide them to the next activity, keep singing
and encourage the children to join in, making the transition feel like part of the song. This not only makes
moving to a new activity fun but also helps the children feel more connected to what’s happening.

#### 4.5.2.2 Storytime with a Puppet

Introduce a friendly puppet to the children, giving it a fun and silly voice. Use the puppet to say a few
playful lines, like “It’s time to eat!” or “Let’s get ready for nap time!” The puppet can gently guide the
children to the next activity by making the transition feel like a game. For example, the puppet might say,
“Can you follow me to the snack table? Let’s go together!” As the children follow the puppet, they are more
likely to stay focused and excited about what’s next. The puppet adds a sense of fun and can be a comforting
presence during transitions.

#### 4.5.2.3 "Touch Your Head" Game

Turn transitions into a mini-game by giving simple instructions like “Touch your head!” or “Touch your
nose!” After the children complete each action, praise them with a big smile and say, “Great job! Now, let’s
go to the next room!” You can continue the game as you move, giving them new actions like “Touch your
toes!” or “Clap your hands!” This keeps the children engaged and makes the transition feel like playtime
rather than just moving from one place to another. The game is simple, fun, and helps the children stay
focused on you as they transition.

#### 4.5.2.4 Deep Breathing with Bubbles

Turn the transition into an imaginative play activity by encouraging the children to pretend to be animals.
Say, “Let’s all be frogs and jump to the next room!” Then, show them how to squat and jump like a frog.
You can also ask them to wiggle like a worm or crawl like a bear. By turning the movement into a game, the
children are more likely to stay focused and have fun as they move from one activity to the next. This kind
of playful movement helps them burn off energy and makes transitions feel less like a chore and more like
an adventure.

#### 4.5.2.5 Carrying a Soft Toy

Give each child a small, soft toy to hold as they transition to the next activity. You might say, “Here’s your
teddy! Can you hold onto Teddy and follow me?” The soft toy gives them something comforting to focus
on, making the transition feel safer and more personal. As the children hold their toys, they can follow you

to the next activity, such as snack time or nap time. The toy acts as a little companion during the transition,
helping the children feel more secure and making the process smoother.

#### 4.5.2.6 Point and Name

Use familiar objects or pictures to help the children understand what’s coming next. For example, if it’s time
to eat, you can point to a picture of food on the wall and say, “Look, it’s food time! Let’s go eat!” The visual
cue, combined with your words, helps the children understand what’s happening and prepares them for the
next activity. You can also use real objects, like holding up a spoon and saying, “Let’s go to the table and use
our spoons!” This simple, direct approach helps the children connect the visual cue with the activity, making
transitions clearer and easier for them to follow.

#### 4.5.2.7 Picture word Cards

Picture Word cards are a great way to visually guide children through transitions. You can create a set of
simple cards that show different activities, like a picture and word of a bed for nap time, a plate for snack
time, or a book for story time. When it’s time to transition, show the children the relevant card and say,
“Look, it’s snack time! Let’s go to the table.” The visual reminder helps them understand what’s happening
next. You can even let them hold the card or point to it themselves, giving them a sense of control and
understanding during the transition. This makes the process smoother and helps them feel more secure about
what’s coming next.

### 4.4.2 Interactive Games

#### 4.4.2.1 Peek-a-Boo

Use a soft cloth or your hands to play peek-a-boo.
This game is excellent for teaching object permanence, a crucial cognitive milestone.
You can vary the game by hiding behind different objects or even involving other children, making it more
social and interactive.

#### 4.4.2.2 Hide and Seek (with toys)


Take a favorite stuffed animal or toy, show it to the child, then hide it under a blanket or behind a pillow.
Encourage them to find it by saying, “Where’s the teddy?” This game enhances problem-solving skills and
can be gradually made more challenging as they grow.

### 4.4.3 Creative Movement

#### 4.4.3.1 Dancing

Play a variety of music genres, from classical to nursery rhymes, and let the children move freely.
You can lead by showing simple dance moves like spinning, clapping, or marching.
This not only burns off energy but also helps with balance, coordination, and rhythm.

#### 4.4.3.2 Obstacle Course

Set up a simple obstacle course using items like cushions, soft tunnels, and large boxes.
Guide the children through crawling, stepping over objects, or going around them.
This helps in developing gross motor skills, spatial awareness, and following instructions.

### 4.4.4 Puppets:

Use hand or finger puppets to bring stories to life.
You can create simple puppets using socks or paper bags.
Act out short stories or nursery rhymes like "The Three Little Pigs" or "Five Little Monkeys".
Puppets make the story more engaging and help develop imagination and emotional expression.

### 4.4.5 Outdoor Exploration

#### 4.4.5.1 Nature Walks

Take the children for short, supervised walks around the outside of the daycare.
Point out trees, flowers, birds, and insects.
Let them touch leaves, feel the texture of tree bark, or listen to the sound of birds chirping.
You can collect small items like leaves or stones to use in later craft activities.

These walks help develop their sensory perception and understanding of the natural world.

#### 4.4.5.2 Water Play

Set up a small water table or a large container with a few inches of water.
Provide cups, funnels, and floating toys.
Water play is not only soothing but also helps with hand-eye coordination as children learn to pour water
from one container to another.
Always supervise closely to ensure safety.

### 4.4.6 Art and Craft

#### 4.4.6.1 Finger Painting

Provide non-toxic, washable paints in a variety of colors.
Let the children explore with their hands, creating patterns and mixing colors.
You can use large sheets of paper or even a plastic tablecloth spread on the floor.
Encourage them to make handprints or simply enjoy the sensation of paint on their hands.
This activity promotes creativity, fine motor skills, and color recognition.

#### 4.4.6.2 Crayons and Paper

Offer large, chunky crayons that are easy for small hands to grasp.
Let them scribble freely on large sheets of paper.
You can also tape the paper to the floor or wall for vertical drawing, which strengthens different muscle
groups.
Over time, guide them to draw simple shapes or follow along as you draw.

### 4.4.7 Social Interaction

#### 4.4.7.1 Group Activities

Organize simple group activities like singing "The Wheels on the Bus" or playing with a large parachute.

For example, you can have the children hold the edges of the parachute and shake it to bounce a ball in the
middle.
These activities promote teamwork, turn-taking, and social bonding.

#### 4.4.7.2 Role Play

Provide dress-up clothes like hats, scarves, or oversized shirts, and simple props like toy phones or kitchen
utensils.
Even at this young age, children enjoy imitating adults, pretending to cook, talk on the phone, or care for a
doll.
This kind of play encourages creativity, social skills, and language development.

## 4.1 PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT IN DAYCARE

### 4.1.1 Gross Motor Skills

#### 4.1.1.1 Crawling / Tummy Time

Rolling over
Lifting head and pushing-up with arms to look around
Dragging on leso
Caregiver’s chest
Place child on your chest while you’re lying on the ground
Then slide around on your back while talking with the child, as you explore the environment together
Crawling on belly
Teasing them with interesting objects
Examples of objects: kalamu, block, hand towel, doll, etc.

Place the object at a small distance where the child can reach it on their own. When they get it, don’t
celebrate too much; talk about how they reached the object and how courageous they are and therefore how
capable they are becoming.
Next time, leave the object at a slightly further distance away, so they have to reach further, or even almost
crawl for a few centimeters. When he reaches the object, don't move it further away. Let him grab it on his
own and play with it.
What if the child is not used to tummy time and cries?
Tummy time for months-old children is a basic part of life, like changing diapers, taking baths, sitting in
crowded matatus, etc.
So, we have to do it even if it makes them cry!
Creeping on hands and knees
It’s a key exercise for people of all ages, children and adults, to practice crawling and creeping.
So we should have floor-crawling and creeping games with all kids in the daycare.

#### 4.1.1.2 Monkey Lift

Technique for beginning children
Let the child grab one of your fingers with each hand.
Pull them upwards until their grip loosens.
Talk about how strongly they grabbed the hand and how high they went.
Advanced children
Require them to ask nicely and respectfully for the privilege of doing the monkey lift.
If they are too young to talk, maybe require them to show prayer-hands 🙏.
Find a place where it is safe for them to fall a short distance.
Maybe do it above your legs, or above a mattress or sofa set.
Lift them up until they are hanging alone from your fingers.

If they are too heavy for your fingers, use a wooden stick.
Talk about how focused and determined they are to hold on.
If they are advanced you can swing a little to make it harder for them.
Cheer when they fall down, regardless of how able or unable they were to hold on.
Stop well before they want to stop.

#### 4.1.1.3 Walking and Running

Practice standing them up on your lap with some support and bouncing them with weight on their legs.
Let them stand or walk while you are holding their arms or hands.
Letting them “coast” by walking while supporting themselves on walls or sofa sets etc.

### 4.1.2 Fine Motor Skills

#### 4.1.2.3 Handling large objects

Self-feeding
Koji / deadbolt
Unfolding leso or kamba

#### 4.1.2.1 Handling small objects

## 4.2 COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT IN DAYCARE

### 4.1.1 Puzzles?

4.1.2
4.3. EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN DAYCARE

4.4. SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN DAYCARE
4.5. LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT IN DAYCARE

### 4.5.1 Caregiver-child conversations

Children feel good when they are engaging with an adult.
This is a priceless gift to the children.
Children are eager to learn and be familiar with their environment and they learn this through their five
senses; touch, sight, hearing, smell and taste.
A caregiver is the child's partner in the child’s learning process.
A caregiver should create an environment for the child to learn as much as they can during every moment of
time they are in the daycare.
A caregiver should seize every opportunity to engage with children through their five senses, maintaining a
calm, cheerful, and approachable demeanor to facilitate meaningful conversations.
A caregiver should engage in conversations with the child, describe what the child and the caregiver is
doing in simple constructive sentences, and pose as a good role model for speech.
Here are some tips of achieving this:
Get into a habit of describing everything the child is doing/ looking at in simple words/sentences.
Get into a habit of describing what you are doing, have done, will do to the child including chores, diaper
changing, preparations for a certain session.
Make yourself a child reporter-reporting to the child what is happening and is in their surroundings in a fun
and creative way.
Make something, a game, story, a way of saying something, with what the child shows interest in.

Try to put yourself in the shoes of a child, who wants to know, explore and is excited to see things for the
very first time of their lives, and be a partner in the exciting journey of the child.
Try to pick a topic that a child is showing interest in.
For example, if the child is looking at a chicken, have a conversation on what the chicken is doing, does and
has.
During the conversations have the following in mind:
Be fun! No child wants to be with a stone-faced person.
Vary your voice tone. Use a high tone then when the child least expects, use soft/calm/whisper and this will
make the child pay attention/participate in the conversation.
Repeat key words of a story or a conversation.
Do not over repeat though as this will be boring to the child.
Keep your very first few sentences simple and straight to the point.
Be equally interested in what the child has an interest in (Match the energy levels)
Praise the child’s effort; good ball!, you are right! very good!
Use excessive facial expressions as children are drawn to faces, and they love watching expressions.
Dramatize! Dramatize pain, joy, actions such as sleeping, jumping, imitating animals.
Encourage the child to express their thoughts and feelings during the conversation.
Here are some tips to achieving this:
In the conversations, use yes and no statements.
A child feels important by having her consulted.
Act out emotions of joy, pain, clap hands. The child may imitate these actions.
Give choices eg. is it this chicken or the other one.
Pause in between the conversation to give the child an opportunity to speak.

Include play! A child learns through play. When the child is helping with chores, they consider it as play.
When the child is trying to walk, it is playing with them.
Children learn best when they’re having fun, so use playful language and engage in activities that make
them smile.
Write down the conversations you make with a child.
4.6. Moral development
NEED TO ADD:

- EL is always developing new caregiving methods, and changing our current programs. So, when a
caregiver fails to clearly explain exactly the precise meaning of what they are trying to communicate,
then other staff will probably misunderstand.

- If your managers and/or Shepherds can understand your meaning clearly, then they will be able to
support you as their caregivers. If they can’t understand clearly, then they will have difficulty
supporting you.

- Months-old and learning to crawl
  - [Example of Daniel without mentioning names]
  - Discussion about how we should balance how much tummy-time we give kids with how much time
we help them to stand

How to make a song book: To be added

- A song book should be between 10-15 pages for the little kid
- A song comes from a game during following interest with the child
- The steps in coming up with a song are:
Following child interest→game→story→song→book
When following interest,the caregiver should:

- continually talk to the child about the activity
- vary their tone and
- use a wide range of facial expressions and gestures to make it interesting and avoid
boring the child, as they progress towards a game.

- After the story, the caregiver should make a song a few lines
- All the words in the song should have been heard and understood by the child
Steps:
1. Pick a kid
2. Pick a favorite interest
3. Talk about what that kid does with that interest
4. Is there a game-like interaction between caregiver and the kid?
5. Is there a song about the game?

Note: Making a song for a game makes it a real game with a real name

- Communication
Communication between parents and staff

    - Staff should provide regular updates on every child’s welfare to the day care
managers who will convey the information to the parent.
