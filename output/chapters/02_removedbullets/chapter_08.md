During my early days of working in the daycare, I used to work alone without a helper. One day, I found
myself having ten kids in the daycare and two new month old crying babies. I was stressed up not knowing
what to do. The day care was in a big mess because I could not manage them by myself. I was so confused,
there was so much complaining from the parents, I even forgot to change some of the young children's
diapers and even feeding them was a problem. I had a very bad day which I will never forget.

S.3 STORY_TITLE
Let me tell you about a friend of mine, who ran a daycare in Kasarani. One morning, a mother dropped off
her baby very early, asking the manager to put him straight to bed so he wouldn't wake up. The manager,
trying to follow the mother's wishes, placed the baby to sleep and let him sleep.
A few hours later, the manager noticed the baby was still sleeping and began to worry—he wasn't usually
this quiet. When she checked on him, she was devastated to find that the baby had passed away.
Panicked, she tried calling the mother, but there was no answer. She took the baby to the nearest hospital,
where the doctor confirmed the heartbreaking news: the baby had died. The doctor then suggested she report
the incident to the police.
At the police station, the manager explained what happened, and they helped track down the mother. When
she arrived, she acted surprised and confused. The investigation revealed that the mother had given the baby
an overdose of medication before bringing her to the daycare which caused his death.
The manager was arrested and later sentenced to prison.
This tragic event taught everyone a crucial lesson about safety and responsibility.
⇒ On-arrival, make sure each child is safe and fully awake, even if the parent asks you to put
a child straight to bed.
