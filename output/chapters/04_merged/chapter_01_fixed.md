## 1.1 New Interested Parents Visiting Daycare

### 1.1.1 Our attitude toward new parents.

- There are two categories of new parents to expect in the Everything is learning daycares:
  - New parents who bring their children with them in search of daycare services.
  - Parents who will not bring their children with them during the daycare services search.
- It is hard to differentiate between real parents who are genuinely interested in daycare services and
those who are competitors and time wasters.

- Despite this EL daycares treat the new parents equally and with respect.

### 1.1.2 Guidelines for receiving new parents in the daycare.

- Greet the parent with a smile, introduce yourself, and thank them for visiting.
- Show them around the daycare, including play areas, nap spaces, and safety features. Note: Only
take a parent for a tour if they have a child with them.

- Briefly share what makes the daycare special and how the daycare cares for the children.
- Show interest in their child by asking about their needs and preferences.
- Introduce the caregivers during the tour and mention their experience with children.
- Let them know you’re always available for questions and value open communication.
- Invite the parent to watch the daycare in action, either now or later.
- Give the parents an intake packet.
- Thank them again and express your excitement about possibly caring for their child.

### 1.1.3 Details the daycare manager should review with the new parent in their order:

#### 1.1.3.1 Eligibility age

El daycares only admit children between 6 months and 24 months. For the following reasons:

- Children develop well in a familiar caregiving environment.
- At age 36 months, we encourage children to begin attending preschool.
- By limiting our enrollment to below 24 months of age, the children will be able to develop in our
care for at least a year, ensuring continuity of care in a familiar environment.

#### 1.1.3.2 [[Availability] - [Capacity]:

- EL daycares have [limited slots] available for children.
- Check the daycare [register] if there are [available slots] and advise interested parents clearly if there
are [no available slots].

#### 1.1.3.3 [Documents - Provide to Visitor:

- The manager may give out a copy of our [intake packet] (link) to any interested parent or other
visitor. Staff may also give this packet to interested visitors if the manager [is delayed for a few
minutes].

#### 1.1.3.4 [Meeting Time - Are we too busy?

- The [manager or assistant manager] should [always] be available to [answer the EL phone], or [greet
a visitor], for at least [a minute or two].

- If the manager is too busy during the day to meet for a longer time with a visitor, or have a longer
phone call, the manager may [schedule] with them to meet [the next day, or in a few days].

- [Parents] should [review] our policies [before] proceeding with [admission plans].
- Particular attention should be paid to:

  - Will they bring their original/actual [Kenya ID card] and let you take a photo of it?
  - Is there any of the [required] information they do not want to give you?

### 1.1.4 Guidelines for handling rude and impatient parents

#### 1.1.4.1 Listening Attitude

- Stay Calm and Professional
  - Take a deep breath and stay composed, even if a parent is raising their voice or being
dismissive.

  - Your being calm can help de-escalate tension.
  - Speak in a calm and measured tone. It reassures the parent that you are listening and taking
the issue seriously.

- Listen Actively
  - Allow the parent to express their concerns fully without interrupting. Sometimes, the parents
just want to be heard.

  - Show that you’re listening by nodding, making eye contact, and using phrases like, “I
understand,” or “I hear what you’re saying.”

#### 1.1.4.2 Gentle Professional Response

- Acknowledge Their Feelings.
  - A simple phrase like, “I understand this is frustrating,” can go a long way.
  - This lets the parent know that their emotions are valid.
  - Avoid using phrases that sound dismissive, like “calm down” or “you’re overreacting.”
- Empathize, but Don’t Apologize for Things Outside Your Control.
  - If the issue is something you can’t control (e.g., daycare policies), acknowledge their
frustration but avoid taking responsibility for things you didn’t cause.

  - Example: “I understand that this policy might be inconvenient, but it's in place to ensure the
safety of all children.”

- Provide Clear, Actionable Solutions.
  - Be solution-oriented: Offer a way to resolve the issue if possible.
  - For example, “I will make sure to communicate with you earlier next time about these
changes.”

  - If the solution isn’t immediate, let them know the next steps: “I’ll speak with the daycare
management/ supervisor and get back to you by a specific time of the day or hour. ”

#### 1.1.4.3 Manage Problems

- Know When to Involve a Supervisor.
  - If the parent continues to be rude or aggressive, or the situation isn’t resolving, forward the
issue to a supervisor or a member of the Shepherd Team.

  - Always remain professional when informing the parent: “I think it would be helpful for my
supervisor to join the conversation so we can resolve this effectively.”

- Set Boundaries If Necessary
  - If a parent becomes abusive or disrespectful, it’s important to set boundaries.
  - You can say, “I want to help you, but I can only do so if we speak respectfully.”

#### 1.1.4.4 Continuous Improvement

- Reflect After the Interaction
  - Once the situation is resolved, take a moment to reflect on how it went and discuss with your
team any improvements or support needed.

  - Don’t carry any negativity with you to your next interaction with a child or parent. Each
interaction should be a fresh start!

- Document the Incident
  - All incidents such as rude parents, parents interview, admission of new children should be
reported and described in the managers Whatsapp group as soon as they occur.

  - The same information should be recorded in the occurrence book.

  - Attendance, punctuality, and payments.
  - If the child is not getting enough attendance to be a “regular”, the manager will explain to the
parent that the child risks losing their spot in the daycare, and what they need to do to keep
the slot.

with monthly or weekly regular attendance, then the child will no longer be eligible for a
reserved slot as a regular.

sure to address the child by name.

children. Listen to the parents' concerns and re-assure them that the child will be well taken care of.

diaper changed and use the potty if the child is on potty.

- Mention any fun or exciting activities planned for the day to build anticipation and excitement.
- If the child seems nervous, reassure them that they’re going to have a great time. Some kids might
need a little extra comfort, like a favorite toy or a hug from the caregiver in charge.

- At the end of the day, make sure to give the child positive feedback, like “You did great today!” This
helps them feel good about coming back.
Note: Making a child feel safe, welcome, and excited on their first day sets the tone for a positive daycare
experience!

##### 6.2.1.1.1 Double-Title Books

- Specification
  - Square ruled like math paper.
  - Clear thick-plastic covers on both sides.
  - Usually available at China Square.
  - Use sizes A4, B5, A5, A6 for different purposes.
- Using both sides of the book for two different titles
  - Both the front and back cover of the notebook are like a front cover of a different book.
  - This allows one physical notebook to have two separate titles, and two separate tables of
contents, etc.

  - When you switch to the other title, flip the book to the other side, and turn it upside down
also.

  - This way, both sides of the book are just like a normal book where the pages turn from left to
right etc.

## 6.3 STAFF ACCOUNTING, NOTES, AND JOURNALING

### 6.3.1 Staff Accounting

#### 6.3.1.1 Importance of Staff Accounting

- In EL Daycares, staff accounting plays a crucial role in ensuring the accuracy and integrity of project
finances.

- Staff accounting basically refers to the accounting functions performed by our staff members within
our Bethesaida daycare as long as E.L is concerned. We have different financial activities which are
being done or have to be done as we grow up. Among those financial (Accounting) activities we
have:

  - recording financial transactions
  - maintaining ledgers
  - Record accounts paid and received.
  - maintaining personal savings.
  - Safety money.
  - Updating inventory book.
  - Preparing financial statements.
  - Assisting with budgeting and forecasting.
  - ...etc.

#### 6.3.1.2 Staff Expense Accounts and Transaction Reporting

- Provision of Kabambe
  - EL may provide a “kabambe” (non-touchscreen) cell phone to an experienced staff member.
  - The staff will get an extra Safaricom sim card in their own name for the kabambe.
- Transaction journal
  - This staff member will keep a paper-based transaction journal of all their purchases with the
kabambe.

  - The transaction journal has the same structure as the Cash Journal (Sec. XX)

#### 6.3.1.3 Damage and Replacement of Kabambe

- Before assigning a caregiver a kabambe, the caregiver will sign a contract accepting responsibility
for the kabambe.

- Possible provisions of this contract:

  - For example, one caregiver might be consistently left to clean up after meals or change
diapers while the other takes on less demanding tasks.

- One caregiver uses a positive approach when handling children’s behavioral issues, while the other
prefers to use corporal punishment. This creates inconsistency in managing the children, confusing
both the caregivers and the children.

- During a shift change, one caregiver frequently forgets to inform the other about important updates
such as a child’s medication, behavior, or any special needs, causing confusion and disruption to the
routine. You mistakenly gave a child a drug that was not theirs!

- During a shared activity such as a big group, one caregiver is very organized and follows routines
strictly, while another is more spontaneous and flexible. This difference creates friction when they
need to coordinate activities or manage the group together.

caregiver is brief or forgets to communicate important information to the manager. Solve the conflict
as a manager

- One caregiver feels that their colleague takes credit for tasks they’ve worked on together, such as
organizing activities or planning a child’s progress report.

- Two caregivers have a personal disagreement outside of work that is starting to affect their
communication and cooperation during their shifts.

tension between caregivers who believe that all children should receive equal attention.

rigid, while the manager believes the caregiver isn’t following the 3 I'm established guidelines.

handle the bulk of the work, while others are given fewer responsibilities.

- Caregivers feel that the manager is assigning an unfair distribution of tasks, where some caregivers
handle the bulk of the work, while others are given fewer responsibilities.

- The manager introduces a new policy, such as changes in the daily routine or handling children’s
meals, and some caregivers feel that it is unrealistic or difficult to implement.
