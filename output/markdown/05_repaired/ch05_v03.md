# **Chapter 1: Foundations of Structured Enrichment (6-36 Months)**

## **1.1 Introduction**

This section outlines the principles and practices for providing structured enrichment to children aged 6 to 36 months in an EL daycare setting. The goal is to create a stimulating, responsive, and joyful environment that supports holistic development.

### **1.1.1 The Importance of Play in Early Childhood Development**

Play is the primary way young children learn about the world. It is essential for developing cognitive, physical, social, and emotional skills. Through structured and unstructured play, children build foundational knowledge, experiment with ideas, solve problems, and learn to interact with others.

### **1.1.2 How to Use This Section**

This guide provides a framework of principles, activity types, and specific games. Caregivers should use these ideas as a starting point, always adapting them to the unique needs, interests, and developmental stages of the children in their care. The key is to be observant, flexible, and responsive.

## **1.2 Guiding Principles for Enrichment**

The following EL-centered principles should inform all interactions and activities.

### **1.2.1 Follow the Child’s Lead**

- **Observation:** Pay close attention to what children are interested in, what they look at, what they reach for, and what makes them excited.
- **Listening:** Engage in conversations, even with pre-verbal children. Respond to their babbles, gestures, and sounds. Interpret their non-verbal cues like facial expressions and body language to understand their needs and feelings.
- **Engagement:** Offer activities that align with their observed interests. Enhance and expand on these interests by introducing new materials or related concepts.

### **1.2.2 Adaptability and Flexibility**

- **Be Ready to Adapt:** If a child shows disinterest in a planned activity, be prepared to change course.
- **Follow Their Lead:** Allow the child's curiosity to guide the direction of play and learning.

### **1.2.3 Provide Choices**

- **Create a Choice-Rich Environment:** Offer a variety of toys, materials, and activities that children can choose from.
- **Balance Freedom with Structure:** While providing choices is important, a predictable structure and routine help children feel secure.

### **1.2.4 Encourage Social Interaction**

- **Facilitate Group Activities:** Organize activities based on common interests to encourage peer-to-peer engagement.
- **Promote Peer Learning:** Create opportunities for children to learn from one another through observation and interaction.

### **1.2.5 Document and Reflect**

- **Keep a Record of Interests:** Note down individual children's interests and developmental milestones.
- **Reflect and Plan Ahead:** Use these observations to plan future activities that are tailored to the children's evolving interests and needs.

### **1.2.6 Communication with Parents**

- **Share Observations:** With the manager's permission, share observations about a child's interests and progress with their parents.
- **Involve Parents:** Encourage parents to share what their child enjoys at home to create a cohesive learning experience.

### **1.2.7 General Activity Guidelines**

- **Embrace a Multisensory Approach:** Incorporate activities that engage multiple senses (touch, sight, sound, smell, taste).
- **Use Everyday and Locally-Available Materials:** Enrichment does not require expensive toys. Sustainable play using common household items or natural materials is highly effective.
- **Keep Activities Fun and Engaging:** The primary goal is joyful learning.
- **Adjust for Skill Level:** Modify activities to be appropriate for each child's age and ability.
- **Celebrate Small Wins:** Acknowledge and encourage every effort and achievement, no matter how small.
- **Stop Before the Child Wants to Stop:** End an activity while the child is still engaged and happy to leave them wanting more next time.

## **1.3 Types of Structured Activities**

Activities can be organized for large groups, small groups, or individuals.

### **1.3.1 Big Group Activities**

These activities involve all children and are excellent for building community and shared experiences.
- **Planning:** Pick up a topic that will go for one day to at-most one week.
- **Examples:** Group exercises, mealtime, singing together, making toys, playing with sand or water, and bubble games.
- **Note:** When having group exercises, always allow the children to do body exercises appropriate for their age and ability.

### **1.3.2 Small Group Activities for Pre-School Preparation**

These focused sessions help prepare older toddlers for a more structured learning environment.
- **Duration:** Do not exceed 10-15 minutes.
- **Intellectual Development:** Assist the kids to develop their intellectual skills.
- **Memory:** Assist them to try to remember what they learned yesterday.
- **Physical Growth:** Assist them to develop their physical growth.
- **Materials:** Use locally-available materials.

## **2.0 Games: Detailed Instructions**

### **2.1 Dancing Games**
Introducing a dancing game to the children in a daycare setting can be a lot of fun! Here’s a simple and engaging way to do it.

**Preparation and Setup**
- Make sure the space where the children will dance is free of obstacles.
- Remove any toys or furniture that could be a distraction.
- If possible, use a soft surface like a rug or mats where the children can comfortably move around.

**Introducing the Game**
- Bring the children together in a circle.
- You can sit down with them first to explain what’s going to happen in a simple way. For example, say, “We’re going to play a fun game where we dance to the music!”
- Keep it very basic. “When the music plays, we dance. When the music stops, we freeze like a statue!” (This can add a playful challenge).

**Demonstrating Moves**
- Start by showing them a few simple moves.
- Clap your hands, stomp your feet, or spin around. Encourage the children to copy what you’re doing.
- Make your movements big and clear so they’re easy to imitate. Smile and show enthusiasm to make it more inviting.
- Once they’re engaged, mix it up with different actions. “Now, let’s march in place!” or “Let’s shake our hips!”
- For very young children, demonstrate each action before expecting them to follow along.

**Using Props**
- Hand out scarves, ribbons, or lightweight fabric for them to wave around as they dance.
- You could also use musical instruments like tambourines or shakers for added fun.

**Praise and Encouragement**
- Praise their creativity by saying things like, “Wow, I love how you’re spinning!” or “Great jumping!”
- Give lots of praise and encouragement. Say things like, “You’re all such great dancers!” or “That was so much fun!”

**Cooling Down**
- Gather the children in a circle at the end, maybe sitting down together. Sing a soft, calming song like “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star” to signal the end of the game.

**Educational Integration**
- Briefly show dance-related word-cards during the dance activity.

### **2.2 Hide and Seek**
This is a game where one closes his eyes for a time, and the rest of the team go elsewhere to hide. After some time, the person goes to find them and if you find one he loses the game. If there is one who is not found from where he is hiding he becomes a winner.

**Game Song**
A song for hide and seek is:
Pirikisho ee (Banturee)
Pirikisho ee (Banturee)
Ni hivyo (hapana)
Ni hivyo (hapana).

**Adapting for Young Children (Gari Class)**
You can also introduce this game to “gari class.” Here are the tips:
- Use a small, confined space like a corner of the room or a play area where the child feels secure and is easy to monitor.
- Make sure there are simple and safe hiding spots, like behind a large cushion, a low table, or even just covering their face with their hands (peekaboo style).
- Start with a game they’re likely familiar with, like “pirikisho ee”. You can say, “Where’s [child’s name]? “Banturee!” There you are!” This helps them understand the idea of someone being hidden and then found.
- Instead of having the child hide, you can hide a favorite toy under a blanket or behind an object and ask, “Where’s the teddy bear?” Encourage the child to find it.
- Hide yourself in a very obvious spot, like behind a chair or a doorframe, where the child can easily find you. Then call out to them, “Where’s [Your Name]?” and when they see you, celebrate with, “You found me!”
- The first few times, hide together with the child. For example, both of you can hide behind a curtain or under a blanket, and then you can peek out together.
- Keep the game very brief, as 1-year-olds have short attention spans. Just a couple of rounds of finding or being found is enough.
- Give lots of praise and smiles when they participate. For example, if they pull the blanket off the hidden toy, say, “You found it! Great job!”
- Use simple language and gestures. If you’re hiding a toy, show them where it’s going, and say, “Let’s find it together!”
- Celebrate every small success with clapping, cheering, and lots of positive reinforcement. This makes the game more exciting for them.
- If the child doesn’t seem interested in hiding or seeking, don’t force him/her. Instead, move on to another activity they enjoy. The goal is to make it fun and stress-free.
- If the child doesn’t seem interested in hiding or seeking, don’t force it. Instead, move on to another activity they enjoy. The goal is to make it fun and stress-free.
- After a couple of rounds, transition to a calming activity like singing a familiar song or reading a book. This helps wind down the excitement of the game.

**How to Play:**
1.  One player is the “traffic light” and stands at one end of the field, facing away from the others.
2.  The other players start at the opposite end.
3.  The traffic light player says “green light,” and the others move forward.
4.  When the traffic light says “red light” and turns around, players must stop and freeze. Anyone caught moving must go back to the starting line.
5.  The first player to reach the traffic light wins.
-   Note: This game emphasizes discipline and following rules.

#### **2.4.5.8 Tag (Mchezo wa kugonga)**
This is a simple chasing game where one player, known as “it,” tries to tag another player.

**How to Play:**
1.  Choose one player to be "it."
2.  The player who is "it" chases the others and tries to tag them.
3.  When a player is tagged, they become the new "it."
4.  Continue until everyone is tired or you set a time limit.

#### **2.4.5.9 Hot Potato**
Players pass an object, the “hot potato,” around a circle while a song is sung, trying not to be the one holding it when the song stops.

**How to Play:**
1.  Players sit or stand in a circle.
2.  A small object (the “potato”) is passed around the circle as everyone sings.
3.  When the song stops, the player holding the potato is out.
4.  Continue until one player remains, who is the winner.

#### **2.5 Lunchtime**

#### **2.5.1 Meal Preparation**
-   If the daycare prepares lunch for children, ensure it is cooked in advance.
-   Daycare lunch is served at 12:00 PM, so meals should be ready before then.
-   Warm up food for children who carried their own lunch from home.

#### **2.5.2 Seating and Environment**
-   Encourage children to sit on a mat for meals, as it is suitable for little kids, rather than on high chairs.
-   Caregivers should also sit on the mat with the children and not on a chair.
-   Sitting together on one level will encourage the children to eat.

#### **2.5.3 Mealtime Routine**
-   Lead the children to say a prayer before eating. Here are some examples:
    -   *Asante Mungu / Kwa chakula / Nikhila unibariki / Katika jina la Yesu / Amina!*
    -   *Mungu nakushukuru (Mungu nakushukuru) / Kwa chakula (Kwa chakula) / Sisi wote pamoja (Sisi wote pamoja) / Twakushukuru (Twakushukuru) / Amina!*
-   Telling an enticing story while children eat can help them settle and listen carefully.
-   This can prevent them from moving around and help them eat their food faster before it gets cold.

#### **2.5.4 Assisting Young Children**
-   Have the young ones who can sit by themselves also sit on the mat with their food placed in front of them.
-   Assist those who cannot eat independently.
-   A caregiver can feed two or three young children at a time, or hold and feed the very young ones individually.
-   Make sure there are enough staff assigned to help with feeding.

#### **2.6 Small-Group Enrichment Activities**

**What is Small Grouping?**
-   Small grouping is where children are organized into smaller, manageable groups for activities, learning, and supervision. In these sessions, a child is monitored, guided, and gets better social interaction with the caregiver.
-   This approach allows caregivers to provide more individualized attention to better fit the different needs of each child, ensuring safety and a better-controlled learning environment.
-   Groups may be based on age or other factors, such as special educational needs.
-   The caregiver’s engagement is often to watch and supervise, letting children struggle and problem-solve.

**Examples of Small-Group Activities:**
-   **One-on-One Activity:** Reading flashcards or a book, letter recognition play.
-   **Storytelling:** Narrating stories to a child or small group.
-   **Sensory Play:** Sand play, water play, sensory bins.
-   **Pretend Play:** Imaginative play with toys.
-   **Games:** Singing games or card games.
    -   **Backwards Card Game:** Hang up to five cards facing backwards (e.g., cards with names of the types of food they are having). Unfold one card at a time and flash it once for the child to see.

**Procedures to Follow:**
-   Divide the children according to their ages or readiness.
-   Have a pull-out session with each child or small group.
-   Follow the child's interests.
-   Make sure you engage the children in close, one-on-one engagement.
-   Write down the experience gained for follow-up.

#### **2.7 Child-Centered Learning Strategies**

#### **2.7.1 Following the Child's Interest**

**Observation**
- **Spend Quality Time Watching:**
  - Dedicate time to simply observe a child during different parts of the day, especially during free play.
  - Notice what they are naturally drawn towards—whether it’s a specific toy, activity, or area of the room.
  - Take note of their facial expressions, body language, and how long they stay engaged with certain activities. For example, if a child consistently spends a lot of time at the art station, it may indicate a strong interest in creative expression.
- **Look for Patterns:**
  - Over a period of days or weeks, look for recurring themes in the child’s play.
  - Do they often choose the same types of toys (e.g., vehicles, animals, blocks)? Do they engage in the same type of activity (e.g., building, pretend play, exploring textures)?
  - Document these observations in a notebook to help identify long-term interests and preferences.

**Listening**
- **Engage in Conversations:**
  - For children who are verbal, engage them in conversations about their activities. Ask open-ended questions like, “What are you building?” or “Tell me about your drawing.”
  - Listen carefully to their responses, as they can provide insights into what excites them.
  - If a child repeatedly talks about a certain topic (e.g., dinosaurs, princesses, trucks), it signals a strong interest that you can explore further.
- **Interpret Non-Verbal Cues:**
  - For younger children or those who are not yet speaking fluently, pay close attention to their gestures, facial expressions, and the sounds they make during play.
  - These cues can communicate joy, frustration, curiosity, or boredom.
  - For example, if a child smiles and claps their hands when playing with water, it indicates they enjoy sensory experiences. Conversely, if they turn away or become disengaged, it might mean the activity doesn’t interest them.

**Engagement**
- **Offer Activities that Align with Their Interests:**
  - Based on your observations and listening, create activities that reflect the child’s interests.
  - If a child loves animals, create an animal-themed day with activities like animal puzzles, books about animals, and a pretend play farm setup.
  - Ensure that these activities are varied in type—include sensory play, physical activities, art, and pretend play to cater to different aspects of their interest.
- **Enhance and Expand Their Interests:**
  - Introduce new materials or challenges that build on their current interests.
  - For instance, if a child enjoys building with blocks, provide them with a variety of blocks (different shapes, sizes, or textures) or introduce construction vehicles to extend their play.
  - If a child loves stacking cups, introduce rings or soft blocks. The idea is to provide variety without losing the essence of what they love.
  - Encourage the child to think creatively and explore new ways to engage with their favorite activities. For example, if they love drawing, introduce pencils, crayons, or different types of paper to broaden their experience.

**Flexibility**
- **Be Ready to Adapt:**
  - While session plans are important, be flexible enough to adjust your plans based on a child’s current interests.
  - If they are deeply interested in a particular activity, allow them to continue rather than rushing them to the next scheduled activity.
  - Recognize that a child’s interest might change from day to day. Stay tuned to these changes and be prepared to shift your approach to accommodate their evolving preferences.
- **Follow Their Lead:**
  - Let the child take the lead in activities. If they want to build a tower instead of playing with the toy kitchen, support their choice. This encourages independence and fosters a sense of ownership over their learning and play.
  - Children often know what they want to do. Allow them to guide the play session without too much redirection.
  - If they are deeply engaged, try not to interrupt with suggestions or new toys. Their concentration is a sign of deep interest, and uninterrupted play is crucial for learning.
  - Offer gentle guidance only when needed, allowing them to explore and experiment on their own. This autonomy helps them develop confidence and problem-solving skills.
  - Match your actions and responses to their pace. If they’re moving slowly, slow down too; if they’re excited and quick, respond with similar energy.
  - Narrate what’s happening in the moment. For example, “You’re pushing the car! Vroom, vroom!” This builds their vocabulary and keeps the interaction engaging.
  - Once you identify what they enjoy, join in. This doesn’t mean taking over but rather participating in a way that enhances their experience.

**Providing Choices**
- **Create a Choice-Rich Environment:**
  - Set up different activity stations in the room, each catering to different interests (e.g., a reading corner, a sensory table, a pretend play area, and an art station).
  - Allow the child to choose where they want to play and what they want to play with. This empowers them and shows that you value their preferences.
  - Rotate materials and toys regularly to keep things fresh and engaging. If a child loves soft toys, swap them with others that have different textures or sounds.
- **Balance Freedom with Structure:**
  - While offering choices, also provide some structure by setting time limits or suggesting transitions between activities.
  - This balance helps children explore their interests while also learning to adapt to routines.

**Documentation and Reflection**
- **Keep a Record of Interests:**
  - Maintain a journal where you document the child’s interests, activities they enjoy, and any significant observations.
  - Include notes on how their interests develop over time and how they respond to different activities.
- **Reflect and Plan Ahead:**
  - Regularly review your notes and reflect on how you can further support the child’s interests.
  - Use this reflection to plan future activities, ensuring that you are continuously aligning with their evolving preferences.
  - Collaborate with colleagues to share insights and get ideas on how to enhance the child’s experience in the daycare.

**Communicating with Parents**
- **Share Observations with Parents:**
  - With the manager's approval, regularly communicate with the child’s parents about their interests and activities in daycare.
  - Provide updates through brief conversations during pick-up and drop-off times.
  - Ask parents if they’ve noticed similar interests at home and if they have any suggestions or insights that could be incorporated into the daycare environment.
- **Involve Parents in the Process:**
  - Encourage parents to share materials or ideas that align with their child’s interests.
  - Work together with parents to create a consistent experience that supports the child’s interests both at home and in daycare.

#### **2.7.2 Planning and Leading Small-Group Lessons**

**Lesson Planning and Structure**
- **Select a Topic:** Choose a topic that can be covered in a single day or last up to one week. For example, for a topic like “Kitchen Utensils”:
  - Teach the children what the kitchen utensils are.
  - Tell them where the kitchen utensils are found.
  - Explain what the kitchen utensils are used for.
  - At the end, show them the real kitchen utensils so that they may understand.
- **Review Previous Lessons:** Before you start a new lesson, make sure children remember what they learned yesterday by asking simple questions about the previous topic.
- **Keep it Brief:** A child's attention span is short, and they can get bored or tired quickly.
  - Do not let the length of the lesson exceed 10-15 minutes.
  - Always stop before the child begins to get bored.
  - Schedule these sessions in the morning when children's minds are fresh.

**Supporting Development**
- **Intellectual Development:** Allow a child to use their brain to think.
  - You can ask simple questions and give them time to think.
  - When they ask questions, use their simplicity to answer them. Speak to them using common words that they understand.
- **Physical Growth:** Provide activities and materials that help develop writing muscles and coordination.
  - Coloring with crayons
  - Modeling with clay
  - Threading yarn with threading-cards
  - Numbering blocks

**Guiding Principles**
- **Use Appropriate Language:** Always use the language children can understand. The questions you ask should depend on the age of the child.
- **Use Locally-Available Materials:** Incorporate materials that are easy to find. After an activity, preserve one or two materials for future reference.

#### **2.8 Fostering Social and Individual Development**

**2.8.1 Encouraging Social Interaction**
- **Facilitate Group Activities Based on Common Interests:**
    - If you notice that several children share a common interest (e.g., riding tires, building blocks, or water play), organize group activities that allow them to explore this interest together.
    - This not only deepens their engagement but also helps develop social skills like sharing, cooperation, and communication.
    - Guide the children in collaborative play, encouraging them to share ideas, take turns, and work together on a common project (e.g., building a large block tower or creating a group artwork).
- **Promote Peer Learning:**
    - Encourage children to learn from each other by pairing those with similar interests or skills.
    - For example, if one child is particularly good at puzzles, they can help another child who is just learning how to fit the pieces together.
    - Create opportunities for children to showcase their work or explain their favorite activities to others.
    - This builds confidence and fosters a sense of community in the daycare.

**2.8.2 Following a Child's Interests**

**Guiding Principle**
- Following a child’s interest refers to observing and understanding their preferences and tailoring activities and experiences that align with those interests.
- In our Bethsaida daycare, we as caregivers pay close attention to what our kids enjoy doing and what they engage in, and then we incorporate those elements into their daily routine through reading flashcards or in other daycare activities like Free-Choice Activities (FCA), Big Group, Small Group, and One-on-One sessions.
- This approach helps us to efficiently foster our child’s curiosity, both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, a continuous reading culture, and overall development.

**Procedure for Following Interests**
1.  **Observe:** Pay close attention to what the child is interested in.
2.  **Interact:** Engage with the child in their interest, showing enthusiasm and curiosity.
3.  **Create a Word Card:** Write a word card referring to the child's interest and read it aloud without leaving the environment.
4.  **Post the Word Card:** Place the word card where the child can access it for reading or observation.
5.  **Provide Materials:** Offer other materials, toys, or opportunities that are of the child's interest, allowing them to explore and engage in reading the cards.
6.  **Encourage:** Support the child in pursuing their interest.
7.  **Offer Guidance:** Provide support or guidance when needed (use your judgment).
8.  **Expand on the Interest:** Where necessary, you can expand the child’s interest by either introducing a related topic (concept) or building upon their current exploration.
9.  **Allow Freedom:** Give the child the freedom to explore their interest in their own way and be respectful of their process.

**Important Considerations**
- Be mindful of time management to avoid disrupting other daycare routines.
- Nurture a child’s development while honoring their unique interests and preferences.
- Make sure the child has gotten the word card opportunities.

**Case Studies: Following Interests in Action**
- **9/10/2023:**
    - During the outside activities session, I pretended to be a rabbit (sungura). Five other kids came, and each said they were a different animal: simba, mbwa, dudu choma, paka, and panya.
    - We had a game of animals as I quickly wrote the five cards. I placed them inside their sweaters, and each kid walked like their chosen animal.
    - When they got inside, they saw a cockroach and they all assembled together to see it. So I went and wrote the word “mende.”
    - They struggled with it and one killed it, so I placed the dead mende on the “mende” card, then I left them watching the dead mende.
    - After pre-breakfast, Jadah was taking her medicine, and all the kids started saying, “Hata mimi nilipewa ‘dawa,’” and they all came to see Jadah taking the medicine.
    - Mary quickly wrote the word-card “dawa” and I placed the medicine on top of the word card “dawa.”
    - We were outside singing, “Gari ya moshi,” while holding each other at the back.
    - While we were walking and singing, someone wrote the word card “gari la moshi.” We put the word card in the middle and we went round it singing: *Gari ya moshi inaenda sana na mzigo wake Piga moshi pi! Pi piiiii!*
- **11/10/2023:**
    - During morning free-choice activities, Makena was brought by her father. Almost every kid stopped what they were doing and went to welcome Makena, saying, “Makena! Makena! Makena!” All of them wanted to pick her up.
    - So, I wrote the word Makena on a card, said “Makena,” and dropped it on the floor. They started playing with Makena and the word card.
    - Afterwards, another kid called Molan came. She had stayed some weeks without coming, and she started crying. They all came and said, “Molan analia! Molan analia!”
    - We wrote the word card, “Molan analia” as Wincrease continued soothing him to stop crying.
- **17/6/2024 - Morning with Blessing and the Bottle:**
    - It was a sunny morning at the daycare, and Blessing, a curious little girl, was on a mission. While the other kids played with toys, something else caught her eye—a plain, empty plastic bottle on the table.
    - She walked over and carefully picked it up with both hands. Her eyes lit up with curiosity. She started by shaking the bottle, giggling as it made a crinkling sound.
    - The way it felt in her hands and the noises it made seemed so interesting to her.
    - I noticed her interest and decided to join in. "What if we put something inside?" I asked. Blessing nodded eagerly, so I brought over a small container of colorful beads.
    - We dropped a few into the bottle, and her face lit up even more when she shook it again. Now, the bottle made a fun rattling sound.
    - Blessing didn’t stop there. She tapped the bottle on the table, on the floor, and even on her knee, each time listening carefully to the different sounds.
    - She turned the bottle upside down, watching the beads tumble from one end to the other, completely absorbed in her little experiment.
    - As snack time approached, I gently guided her to the table, but not before she gave the bottle one last shake, smiling at her new favorite toy.
    - This simple bottle had become a whole world of discovery for Blessing, showing how much joy and learning can come from following a child’s natural curiosity.

**2.8.3 Special Considerations**

**Children with Special Educational Needs**
- **Case Example: Child “A”**
    - **Basic Details:**
        - **Age:** 3
        - **Condition:** Mild Autism (Asperger)
        - **Description:** She is a happy girl. Loves to play alone. Non-verbal but producing some sounds, healthy looking. Has good fine and gross motor skills. Loves to play and stay alone; however, she makes few attempts to play with the rest. She has good hearing.
    - **Interventions for the Day:**
        - Minimize the noise levels.
        - Provide independent play items, such as colorful flashcards.
        - Don’t force her to interact with the other children, but she should be encouraged to.
        - Find a way of communicating and getting feedback from visual cards.
        - Have a routine that should be followed strictly.
        - Have swings and independent play objects.
        - Be strict with her. Always encourage good behavior.
        - Treat them with a lot of love.

**Staff with Their Own Children in the Daycare**
- Having staff with their own kids in the daycare is not easy and can be challenging. Here are some ways to overcome the situation respectfully:
    - Help the kid to be more independent.
    - Ignore the kid sometimes so that they might not think that you are always there for them only.
    - Make sure that as a staff member, you are doing all your daycare activities effectively.
    - Staff members must not be biased among all the kids.
    - Take your kid like others inside the daycare by obeying rules and regulations established to avoid any internal conflict based on that.
    - Have flexible schedules, especially for the staff with very little kids.
    - Understand their needs when necessary.
    - Encourage effective communication about how the situation is between balancing the daycare routine (work) and caregiving (parenting).
    - Encourage team staff members to share activities and responsibilities.
    - Recognize and appreciate staff for the work done and dedication, for being both caregivers and parents all at once, to boost their morale and motivation.
    - Disciplining should be done strictly (twice that of another kid to show a good example).

**2.8.4 Using Flashcards**

**What is a Flashcard?**

**2.8.5 Flashcard Design and Formatting**
The size of the text and the card depends on the age and ability of the child.
-   **Age:** Refers to eye development.
-   **Ability:** Refers to reading development.

**General Layout and Spacing**
-   **Vertical Margins:** Keep blank space above and below the words that is at least the height of the letters.
-   **Horizontal Margins:** Keep blank space to the left and right of the words that is at least three times the width of the letters.
-   **Line Spacing:** Keep the same space between lines if there are multiple lines of text on the same card.
-   **Centering:** The word(s) should be centered vertically and horizontally.
-   **Siding:** Flashcards are single-sided.

**Sizing by Age Group**
-   **For newborn infants:**
    -   Cards should be about 50cm wide and 30cm tall (approximately twice the size of a sideways A4 paper).
    -   Letters should be 10cm tall.
    -   Use a thick marker with strokes about 1cm in thickness.
-   **For children between 12 months and 2 years old:**
    -   Card size should be in-between the newborn and 2-year-old size, according to your judgment.
-   **For children 2 years and older:**
    -   Cards should be about half the size of an A4 sheet, cut lengthwise (approx. 30cm wide and 10cm tall).
    -   Use a normal-size thick marker.
-   **For more experienced children:**
    -   Use a normal-size thick marker.
    -   Cards may have multiple words or a sentence with two or three lines of text.
    -   A sideways A4 size paper may be used to fit multiple lines of text.

**2.8.6 Flashcard Materials**
The material used for a flashcard depends on its intended use.
-   **Following-Interest Flashcards:** These may use lower-quality paper as they may not need to be reused.
-   **Set-Flashcards:** These are reused over a 5-day cycle, two to three times per day, so they should be made from durable manila paper.
-   Otherwise, there is no difference in how the words are sized and written.

**2.8.7 Using Pictures with Words**
EL flashcards do not include pictures. If we put pictures together with words, we call those "toys."
-   **Paper Silhouette Toy:**
    -   This is a paper cut-out silhouette of an object or animal, often laminated.
    -   The word for that object or animal is written on the paper with a marker in flashcard style.
    -   Multiple cards may be assembled and taped together to make a car or dollhouse, etc.
-   **Word/Picture Guessing Cards**
-   **Wearables:**
    -   These are paper cards that can be worn or otherwise attached to the body with clothespins or string.
    -   They may represent parts of the body, clothing, animal masks, etc.
    -   A word is written somewhere on the card.

**2.8.8 Flashcard Presentation Techniques**

**Adult Positioning**
There are three main options for positioning when flashing cards or reading books.
-   **Face to Face (F2F) Position:**
    -   You are seated, kneeling, or standing leaning over, facing the child directly.
    -   **Advantage:** You can see the child’s face and reactions.
    -   **Disadvantage:** You aren’t in physical contact with the child, which may decrease your connection to them.
-   **Simple Lap-Sit (SLS) Position:**
    -   The child is on your lap facing forward and away from you.
    -   **Advantage:** You are in full physical contact with the child; they are happy to be in your lap.
    -   **Disadvantage:** You can’t see their face, so you may not be immediately aware of changes in their interest and emotions.
-   **Three-Point Triangle (3PT) Position:**
    -   The child is on your lap facing diagonally towards you. A triangle is formed by your face, the child’s face, and the book/card. All three are facing each other.
    -   **Advantage:** You are in good physical contact with the child and can also see their face at the same time.
    -   **Disadvantage:** The position is a halfway compromise between the advantages and disadvantages of F2F and SLS.

**Letting the Child Choose Their Position**
-   If the child is able to stand or crawl, it’s best if you let them choose their own position.
-   You may place them in a position (F2F, SLS, or 3PT), but if they change their position from that point, do not keep moving them into your desired position.
-   Remember, with flashcards, always “Let the Child Decide”!

**2.8.9 Managing Disinterest**
If a child shows disinterest in the cards, you can try these strategies:
-   Put your prepared cards away for a moment and follow their interest. If there isn’t much time left, you could skip the flashcard session for that small-group period.
-   Let them follow their own interests until they get bored. Their interest may return to your cards after 5 or 10 minutes.
-   Play a teasing game with them where you hide the cards as they chase after them. Then you might:
    -   Flash one or two cards, give them to the child for 10 or 20 seconds, and then put them away.
    -   Or, play whatever game they’re interested in, make one or two word-cards out of that, and then adjust the set of 5 cards to include the new words-of-interest. Continue in later sessions with the new card set as normal.

### **2.9 Using EL Books**
An EL book is a book created specifically for the child, often based on their interests and experiences.

**2.9.1 Types of EL Books**
-   **Favorite-Word Books:** These books contain a collection of the child's favorite words and do not include pictures.
-   **Storybooks:** These are created according to the IGSSB process.
    -   **Pictures in Storybooks:** We can sometimes put a few pictures in. We place the pictures on separate pages from the words. Only the front cover can have words and a picture on the same page.

**2.9.2 The IGSSB Process for Creating Storybooks**
The IGSSB process is: **I**nterest → **G**ame → **S**tory → **S**ong → **B**ook.
-   If the child enjoys a game, you can make it an exciting story.
-   If the story is interesting to the child, then you can make it a song so it’s enjoyable to hear multiple times.
-   If the child enjoys the song, then you can make it a book.
-   Explain the IGSSB process in detail with an example.

**2.9.3 Book Creation and Formatting**
-   **Formatting:** The formatting of pages in a book is almost the same as formatting individual A4 word-cards. The only difference is you should increase the left margin by an additional 3cm to give more space for the stapling/binding.
-   **Binding:** Use staples and duct tape.

### **2.10 Daycare Games for Children Under 36 Months**
**2.10.1 Introduction**
This section is designed to inspire caregivers to use play as a powerful learning tool in supporting children under 36 months. Through simple games that use locally available materials, caregivers can engage children’s senses, develop motor skills, nurture language, and stimulate curiosity, all while building essential bonds. These activities offer more than play—they’re an early foundation for lifelong learning.

**2.10.2 The Importance of Play in Early Childhood Development**
In the EL culture, play is essential for a child’s growth and development. For young children, play is their primary “work,” a natural means of exploring the world around them. Each game, each object, and each interaction offers a new opportunity for children to discover, learn, and grow. Play aids in developing cognitive skills, motor coordination, language, social interaction, and emotional resilience. The activities in this section aim to provide purposeful, joyful play that nurtures all aspects of a child’s development holistically.

**2.10.3 How to Use This Section**
**2.10.3.1 EL-Centered Principles to Keep in Mind**
-   **Follow the Child’s Lead**
-   **Adaptability and Flexibility**
-   **Celebrate Small Wins**
-   **Embrace a Multisensory Approach:** Involve all senses in learning. Engaging touch, sound, sight, and movement deepens each learning experience. Remember you are to pull in some flashcards!
-   **Stop before the child wants to stop**
-   **Adjusting for Skill Level**
-   **Keeping Activities Fun and Engaging**
-   **Using Everyday Materials**

**2.10.4 Overview of Materials Used**
One of the greatest strengths of the EL culture is that it’s rooted in resourcefulness, drawing on inexpensive, everyday materials familiar to the Kenyan context. EL uses simple, accessible materials such as cloth scraps, containers, bottle caps, and natural elements like stones and leaves. These materials make the activities feasible for any caregiver, anywhere, while connecting children to their environment. For example, a stick found outdoors can become a tool for a game, connecting play to nature and building familiarity with the child’s surroundings.

### **2.10.5 Game Activities**

#### **2.10.5.1 Introduction to Developmental Play**
Sensory play is essential for young children as it stimulates their senses and supports cognitive, language, social, and motor development. In early childhood, developing motor skills is also fundamental to a child’s overall growth and independence. Motor skills enable children to interact physically with their environment, engage in play, and gradually perform everyday tasks. The following games explore various sensory and motor activities that utilize inexpensive, locally available materials, making them accessible for caregivers in any context.

The EL culture emphasizes learning through active engagement and discovery, meaning that even simple, playful movements contribute to foundational development. In line with EL principles, these games prioritize a child’s freedom to explore at their own pace, guided gently by caregivers. By fostering a nurturing, positive environment, caregivers help children build confidence in their movements and embrace new challenges. Using locally available materials, these games aim to make skill-building accessible, enjoyable, and impactful at any stage of development.

#### **2.10.5.2 General Guidelines for Play**
- Be as jovial as possible
- Act like a child, think like a child
