# 4 Child Interaction Strategies

## Child Development in General
**Every moment with a child is a chance to build a better future.**

### Scenario: Amani vs. Baraka
Let us imagine two 8-month-old babies in different daycares.

**Amani:**
- Fed on time



- Diaper changed on time



- Left sitting or lying alone



- Little eye contact



- No talking, no play, no stimulation




**Baraka:**
- Fed on time



- Diaper changed on time



- Talked to during feeding



- Engaged in finger games and tummy time



- Responded to with smiles and encouragement



- Engaged in play, read books



- Engaged in decision making




**Answer the following questions. Which child is:**
- Learning faster?



- Building brain connections every minute?



- Likely to talk and walk earlier?



- Likely to understand feelings faster?



- Forming secure attachments and a strong identity?




Let us talk about Baraka.

**Baraka is not just surviving, he is thriving.** Baraka is being stimulated, challenged, loved and guided in every interaction.

**Key Insight:**
- Children who are only tended to develop slowly



- Children who are interacted with develop holistically




An EL caregiver is not only a babysitter but a **child developer**. Every moment you have with a child is an opportunity to support the child in cognitive development, social-emotional development, physical development, and language development.

### Holistic Child Development
1. "Holistic" and "Development"

  * Holistic refers to “whole-person.” Development means growth and change.



  * Holistic child development includes all the growth and change happening in a child, from



birth through early adulthood.
2. The child’s whole-person includes their:

  * Personal self: Physical body, emotions, thinking brain, relationships with others



  * External connections to: Family, friends, neighborhood, institutions like schools and



governments etc.

### Personalized Care - Attentive and Flexible
What is personalized care?

- It is focusing on a child as an individual with unique needs and a unique developmental pace.



- It is tailoring a child’s care to respond to their unique needs and developmental pace.



- It is tracking a child’s development across all aspects of development to identify areas where



they may need more support or greater challenge.

- A caregiver’s response to a child should be based on the child’s verbal and nonverbal cues,



their response to current needs, interests, and emotional states.
Choosing the EL technique to apply

- There are over 20 EL techniques tailored for different occurrences.



- The application of EL techniques depends on:



  * Interests of the child



  * Desired behaviour



  * Needs of the child



  * Safety of the child



  * Holistic development path of the child



  * Child environmental needs and experiences



- It is not easy to deduce a child’s needs or moods, but you have to try.



- As a caregiver, you need to be attentive to holistic development path, needs, safety, current interests



and behaviours and history of the child.

- Once you are attentive, be flexible and adjust the EL caregiving techniques and strategies.




### Four Primary Aspects of Child Development
- 4.1.3.1 Why should we separate out different aspects of development?



- It helps us organize our thinking about the child.



  * We can use the list of aspects like a checklist for checking on children and communicating



about the child between caregivers and family members.

- EL prioritizes all aspects of the child’s development.



  * The main categories are: physical, cognitive, emotional, and social.



- Each child develops at their own pace, with different speeds of development in different aspects.




#### Physical Development
Growth:

  * Growth of the body and brain, in size and detail, over time.



Motor skills:

  * Gross motor skill development:



    + Learning and controlling actions with large movements of the arms, legs, and body.



    + Examples: walking, running, pushing a door, and hitting a ball.



  * Fine motor skill development:



    + Learning and controlling actions with careful and small movements of the fingers and



other body parts.

    + Examples: opening and closing a koji deadbolt, wearing and removing shoes, and



using a pencil to write or draw on paper.
Sensory capabilities:

  * Ability to focus the lenses of the eyes



    + Shifting between seeing detail up close, and from far away.



  * Becoming familiar with different object textures by feeling them with the hands.



    + Sand, a cement wall, a steel door, a sofaset



    + Hot versus cold; wet versus dry



  * Becoming aware of feelings from all different parts of the body.



    + Wind in the face, taste, smell, hearing, etc.




#### Cognitive Development
Cognitive development involves the way children learn to think, understand, and solve problems.

  * As children grow, they develop memory, reasoning skills, the ability to understand cause and



effect,etc

  * Problem solving opportunities



Examples of problem solving opportunities[just enough challenges without testing]

  * Levels of problem solving opportunities



  * Level 1



  * Is when you do an activity and help the child on how to do it



  * Level 2



  * Is allowing the child to do it while giving instructions



  * Level 3



  * Is allowing the child to do it independently without any instructions



  * Eg:



  * When you have 3 drawn pictures of Mbwa,bata na kuku



  * Level 1..caregiver assign named animals and welcome child second opinion



  * Level 2...same, but don't idea it first let the child have the moment to try to idea the card



  * Level 3..shuffle the cards let the child play unattended,then ask for explanation.[trick



tujifanishe,tufanyiane]

#### Emotional Development
Children gradually learn to identify, express, and manage their emotions.

  * They learn to recognize their own feelings, show them through actions, and identify them



with language.

  * Children can develop empathy for others. That is, when they notice another child or adult



person experiencing an emotion, then this may cause them to experiencing a similar emotion
themselves.

  * Children can learn to manage their own emotions.



    + Extreme expressions of excitement and frustration are usually not welcome around



other people.

    + Kids learn to express appropriate emotions according to normal social expectations of



respect and politeness.

#### Social Development
Social skills develop as children interact with adults and other children.

  * This includes sharing, cooperating, and communicating.



  * Using these skills, they begin gaining experience building and maintaining relationships with



peers and adults.

### Cross-cutting Aspects of Child Development
#### Language Development
What does language include?

  * Body and hand gestures, grunts, mouth noises, and any purposeful nonverbal communication



are part of language.

  * Language begins with babbling, and progresses to full speech.



  * Words and sentence structures help children express their thoughts, ask questions, and engage



in conversations.
Cross-cutting connections between language development and primary aspects of child development:

  * Receiving and creating language requires physical development.



  * Processing language depends on cognitive development.



  * Language is linked with social development, as meaningful interactions and relationships



accelerate language development, and vice/versa.

#### Moral Development:
Moral development connects across emotions, cognitive thinking, and social interactions.
As children grow, they begin to understand the difference between right and wrong and the gray areas in
between.
Their moral reasoning evolves through interactions with parents, caregivers, and other children, including
structured guidance from adults.

## EL Child Development Framework: Motor, Brakes, and Pilot Controls
### Motor, Brakes, and Pilot Controls - The Overall Metaphor
**Motor:** Capabilities and creativity
- EL techniques that utilize a child's energy, curiosity, and emotions to drive holistic development



- Capabilities and creativity drive holistically healthy child development




**Safety Brakes:** Gentle discipline when needed
- EL techniques that slow things down when needed---calmly, without shame



- Gently positive rewards, gently negative consequences



- These decrease creativity as they increase discipline




**Airplane Takeoff Pilot Controls:** Self-motivation and independence
- Levels 1, 2, 3 of development, motivation, and challenge



- Maturing toddlers and preschoolers develop goals and priorities, and become passionate about these learning priorities



- This is an opportunity for the caregiver to coordinate their energies toward self-motivated takeoff -- in their journey of lifelong learning!




**Gari and Ndege Class Application:**

This illustrative metaphor connects with our "gari" and "ndege" classes:

- **Gari class** deals more with the motor and brakes, as their abstract sense of cause/effect is not yet as thoroughly developed. These younger children need more hands-on engagement and gentle guidance.




- **Ndege class** has an understanding of cause and effect, which connects them to the world of self-motivation, and eventually to independent flight. These older children are ready for more self-directed learning and decision-making.




### Motor: Creativity, Capabilities
#### Motor Metaphor in-depth
- What do motors do?



  * Receive energy as input



  * Produce rotating cycles of movement as



output

- What are the child's "energy" and "movement"?



  * The child's energy comes from their



playful curiosity and creative joy.

  * The movement resulting from a well-organized motor is the child's healthy development in



all aspects. This can be seen as their capabilities increase.

#### Overview of the motor’s cycle and diagram
##### Main parts of the motor’s cycle
7. The cycle looks like this:

  * a stack ([stack]) representing a situation or state of being, moving into:



  * an arrow (<-) representing a change or flow, connecting to:



  * a second situation “stack” ([stack]) moving into:



  * a second arrow (->) representing a change or flow...



  * ...connecting back to the first stack ♻.



8. Experiences of fun and success (right-side stack [stack])

  * These are the biggest drivers of a child’s learning and growth.



  * Fun and success leave good memories, motivating children to chase after similar experiences.



9. Courageous creative efforts (lower movement <-)

  * These efforts exercise kids physically and mentally.



  * The exercise increases the kids' capabilities.



10. Stock of abilities and powers (left-side stack [stack])

  * A child has some level of abilities and powers at any moment.



  * The way a child shows those abilities changes -- with the environment, and over time.



  * The Bayley Scales assessment tries to measure the child's abilities based on their age



development expectations.
11. Enabling fun and success (upper movement ->)

  * Growing capabilities means that a child will encounter fresh challenges.



  * A developing child will often succeed against new challenges. They will be able to play new



games that they weren't able to play before, or play old games in new ways.

  * These fresh successes are memorable and motivating!




##### Types of experiences of fun and success (right-side stack [stack])
12. Exploring is a way that the child accesses external stimulation. The child actively moves through
and observes their environment, using five senses to find out all the information they can.
13. Experimenting is an even more active way to get stimulation from the external environment. The
child engages their surroundings, trying to change things with bodily actions, or using one object on
another. The child may feel especially excited and empowered to learn about cause-effect
relationships, for instance, that the light switch may cause the lamp to turn on its brightness, etc.
14. Imagining is a simulation of a scenario in the child’s mind. It’s an expression of internal creativity,
where the child has learned enough about something in the environment that they can experience a
new story about it, without needing to explore or experiment every time.
15. Creating is when a child builds on their imagination to bring something from their imagined stories
out into the real world.

##### Courageous creative efforts (lower movement <-)
###### Growth through effort
These efforts exercise kids physically and mentally.
The exercise increases the kids' capabilities.

###### Peak-end
- The "peak" refers to the most joyful, exciting, or engaging parts of a child's activity or game.



- Always end the game/activity when the child:



  * is getting interested



  * is almost getting excited



  * wants more engagement



- This helps the child to:



  * yearn for more and value any moment when an adult/ caregiver plays a game with them.



  * not get bored with an activity easily.



  * treasure moments when an adult/caregiver is engaging with them.



  * have good memories and longings of activities/ games they have engaged with.



- Children may not remember all activities/games they engaged in during the day but will remember:



  * Exciting engagements



  * Painful engagements



  * Shocking engagements




###### Ambivalent choices
This is offering choices for the child to decide.

- There are two types of choices:



  * Constrained or structured choices



    + Caregiver offers the child two or three options to choose from.



    + For example, "Do you want to play with a cat or dog?"



    + This is useful with children without a habit of good decision-making in this kind of



environment.

  * Open-ended choices



    + The adult/caregiver controls the environment, providing activity supplies etc. The



child is not restricted to making any choices, they choose what to do first, how to do
it, etc.

    + For example, a caregiver leads a child into a room where there is a tray on the floor



with modeling clay. Then the caregiver sits in a corner and begins reading a book to
themself silently, without giving further directions to the child.

    + This is useful with children whose basic behavior habits are good enough that they



can be independent and creative in this environment without misbehaving.

- The choices should be:



  * Only what is acceptable to the caregiver/adult.



  * safe for both the child and the caregiver/ adult.



- In the making of choices:



  * The child is in control -- the child is the boss!



  * Whatever the child chooses is always "the best", and the caregiver should celebrate it.



- In making choices, the caregiver should not:



  * have a favourite or prefered choice,



  * think from an adult’s perspective,



  * react negatively due to the child’s choice.



- In making choices, the adult/ caregiver should:



  * provide choices that the caregiver is comfortable with,



  * support the choices that the child makes, using positive body language and expressions even



when the child fails to make the caregiver's secretly-preferred choice.

  * be sincere with the child, by putting in effort to think from the child’s perspective.



  * These builds trust with the child.



- Benefits of ambivalent choices to the child include:



  * Unconscious decision to focus on an activity/ game.



  * Enhances task or activity performance from the child.




##### Stock of abilities and powers
16. Physical abilities that we can look for in a child:

  * Mobility (gross motor): Rolling over, crawling on belly, crawling on hands and knees,



walking while supporting balance with hands, walking, running and jumping, socially
intentional body postures.

  * Manipulation (fine motor): Moving arms and legs, coordinated reaching/touching/pushing,



coordinated whole-hand grabbing, separate movement of fingers, intentional large object

manipulation like plastic chairs or large dolls, intentional small tool use such as koji or
pencil/paper, refinement of tool use like careful hand posture for writing.
17. Mental abilities that we can see in a child:

  * Recognition:



    + Seeing a person's face and identifying it is the parent



  * Understanding:



    + Responding appropriately to familiar gestures or words.



  * Voice:



    + Recognizing and reacting to familiar voices, such as turning towards a parent’s voice.



18. Physical abilities that we can't see as caregivers:

  * Strengthening of muscles and joints, preparing for future motor skills like rolling, crawling



and sitting.

  * Development of internal coordination for balance and movement.



  * Growth of reflexive responses that later become voluntary actions.



19. Mental abilities that we can’t see as caregivers:

  * Formation of early memory pathways.



  * Recognition of familiar voices, sounds and patterns.



  * Emotional bonding and security development.



20. Encouraging intrinsic motivation

  * Stop when the child is having the most fun - reference: "Peak-End" -Daniel Kahneman



  * Offer ambivalent choices - reference: "Internal Drive" -Petunia Lee



21. Arrange opportunities for fun and success

  * Ensure emotional safety through a healthy environment and community



  * Arrange self-play opportunities without distractions



  * Provide just-enough-challenge activities where the child can build confidence through small



independent successes.

22. Arrange an environment and timetable that extends the child’s abilities, enabling them to try more
diverse challenges.

  * Use catchy memory tricks like songs, games, jokes, and funny pictures to speed up their



recognition.

  * Scheduled activities and other stimulations according to a calendar of decreasing-frequency,



to help the child pick-up physical and mental abilities.
23. Brakes
24. Airplane takeoff pilot controls

  * Preserve the Privilege (see Section 1.7 for detailed coverage)



  * Just enough challenge

## Communicating with Children
- Speak at their level---use simple, clear words.



- Listen carefully and show interest in what they say.



- Ask open-ended questions (e.g., "What are you building?").



- Give them time to respond.




- Incorporate Play into Conversations:



  * Children learn best when they’re having fun, so use playful language and engage in activities



that make them smile.

  * For example, if you’re playing with animal toys, you can say, “The cow says moo! Can you



say moo?” or “Let’s march like elephants!” This kind of playful interaction keeps them
engaged and makes learning feel like a game.

- Sing and Use Rhymes:



  * Songs and rhymes are excellent tools for language development because they introduce



rhythm, repetition, and new words.

  * You could sing “The Wheels on the Bus” while doing the actions, or recite a simple rhyme



like “gari ya moshi linaenda sana” and encourage the child to join in with the words or
actions.

- Use expressive tone and Body Language:



  * Change your tone of voice to match the situation---speak softly when something is quiet or



whisper when it’s a secret, and raise your voice in excitement when something is fun.

  * Complement your words with body language, like clapping when you’re happy or pretending



to tiptoe when you’re being quiet.

  * This makes the conversation more dynamic and engaging.



- Interactive Reading:



  * Reading with a child is a great way to build language skills.



  * Encourage the child to read by allowing them to turn pages as you read aloud with them.



  * We should allow the child to turn pages independently but first we have to give them the



minimal assistance by just lifting the pages a little bit.(hand under the page technique)

  * Always be patient for them to open the book by themselves and if the child loses the interest



you should not chase for the interest,but allow the child to come back naturally

  * Always use the book or the or the flashcard as something enjoyable not boring



  * We should apply hand under the page technique when training the child how to turn pages



independently.

  * You should try to be creative even if you are doing one on one flashcards sessions.



  -
  * Encourage the child to point, respond, or even finish a sentence if they know the words.



  * This makes reading interactive and helps them connect with the words.



- Encourage Them to Communicate:



  * When the child is trying to say something, whether it’s a word, a sound, or even just a



gesture, give them time to express themselves.

  * Avoid finishing their sentences or rushing them. Instead, show that you’re listening by



making eye contact, nodding, and responding positively to whatever they say or do.

- Respond to Their Interests:



  * Pay attention to what catches the child’s interest and use it as a conversation starter.



  * For example, if they’re fascinated by a truck passing by, you might say, “Look at that big



truck! It’s so loud! What color is it?” Engaging with their interests shows that you value their
thoughts and encourages them to share more with you.

- Talk Throughout the Day



  * Use routine activities like snack time, dressing, or clean-up as opportunities to chat and teach



new words.

  * For example, during snack time, you can talk about the different foods, their colors, and how



they taste: “You’re eating a banana.

  * It’s yellow and sweet!” During clean-up, you can say, “Let’s put the toys away. We’re



cleaning up!”

- Encourage Independence with Language:



  * Encourage the child to use words to express their needs and desires during daily routines.



  * For example, if they’re reaching for a toy, prompt them by saying, “Do you want the truck?



Can you say ‘truck’?” This not only helps them practice their language skills but also fosters
a sense of independence.
The rules of the language development program for young babies:
Do

- Always listen to the baby.



- Look as if you are listening.



- Be willing to wait for a response.



- Accept the fact that the baby decides whether to respond or not,it is his choice.



- Respond to what he says.



- Welcome enthusiastically to every effort the baby makes to talk.



- Assign meaning to the specific sounds the baby says repeatedly.



- Use real words when talking to the baby.



Don’t

- Don’t use “baby talk” with the baby.



- Do not ignore the baby.



- Don’t ask a question and leave no time for him to answer.



- Don’t neglect to answer him.



- Don’t imitate or make fun of the sound he makes.



- Don’t correct his pronunciation.



- Don't try to force the child to answer or respond.




4.2. Using Flashcards During Routine Daycare Activity

- Staff should flash word flash cards to children during play, reading the words as he or she flashes



them to expose the child to more vocabulary.

## Behavior and Habit Change ("Disciplining" the Kids)
### The Safety Brake: When to Discipline
**What is the Safety Brake?**

Think of a car's safety brake---you pull it when something might go wrong.

In EL, we say "Let's pull the safety brake" when the child:
- Is too excited



- Is unsafe



- Is hurting others



- Is getting out of control




The Safety Brake tells you when to pause, guide, or gently redirect, depending on the child's needs.

**👍 Use a Safety Brake When:**
- Child is overexcited or aggressive



- Unsafe behavior is shown



- Child is upset and needs calm




**❌ Do NOT Use Safety Brake For:**
- Curiosity



- Mistakes



- Normal fussiness




The Safety Brake includes gently positive rewards and gently negative consequences. These increase discipline but decrease creativity, so use them thoughtfully and only when necessary.

### Guiding principle for discipline in the daycare
- Disciplining young children in EL daycare without using corporal punishment involves a lot of



patience, clear communication, and positive support.
Here are some effective strategies:

#### Redirection
- Explanation



  * Young children have short attention spans and can be easily distracted.



  * Redirection involves shifting their focus from an undesirable behavior or situation to



something more appropriate or engaging.

  * This method helps prevent frustration and tantrums while teaching them acceptable



alternatives.

- Implementation



  * Identify the Misbehavior:



    + Observe what the child is doing that is inappropriate, such as throwing toys or pulling



another child’s hair, hitting other children, pushing , hitting or “chapa”

  * Introduce a New Activity:



    + Calmly and eagerly introduce a different activity.



    + For example, if a child is throwing toys, you could say, “Let’s go build a tower with



these blocks!” or “Can you help me find all the red toys?”

  * Provide a Positive Alternative:



    + Offer a similar but safe alternative to the behavior.



    + If they are throwing objects, suggest throwing a softball in a designated play area



instead.

#### Setting Clear Boundaries
- Explanation:



  * Children at this young age are just beginning to understand rules and boundaries.



  * Clear and consistent rules help them learn what is expected of them, creating a sense of



security and order.

- Implementation:



  * Simple Language: Keep instructions short and direct. Instead of saying, "Please don't do



that," say, "Toys stay on the shelf."

- Be Consistent:



  * Consistency is key.



  * Make sure all caregivers follow the same rules and consequences to avoid confusing the



child.

- Explain the Why:



  * Even though children might not fully understand, explaining why certain behaviors are not



allowed helps them start to make connections.

  * For example, “We use gentle hands because hitting hurts our friends.”




#### Positive Reinforcement
- Explanation



  * Positive reinforcement involves rewarding desired behavior to encourage it to be repeated.



  * This method helps children understand which behaviors are acceptable and gives them a



sense of accomplishment.

- Implementation:



  * Immediate Praise:



    + Offer immediate and specific praise when the child behaves well. For example,



“Thank you for sharing the toys with your friend!”

  * Use Body Language:



    + In addition to verbal praise, use smiles, claps, or high-fives to show approval.



  * Reward Systems:



    + Although very young children may not fully understand complex reward



systems, simple acknowledgments like stickers or stamps for good behavior
can be effective.

#### Offering Choices
- Explanation



  * Giving children choices helps them feel empowered and reduces resistance. It also teaches



decision-making skills in a controlled environment.

- Implementation:



  * Limited Options:



    + Offer two choices that both lead to the desired outcome. For example, “Do you want



to pick up the red blocks or the blue blocks?” This method avoids overwhelming the
child while still giving them a sense of control.

    + Positive Framing:



    + Always frame the choices positively.



    + Instead of saying, “You can either stop crying or sit in the corner,” say, “Would you



like to sit with me or play with the toys?”

#### Time-In (Instead of Time-Out)
- Explanation



  * Time-in focuses on understanding the child’s feelings and teaching them how to manage their



emotions, rather than isolating them as a punishment.

  * This approach promotes emotional regulation and reinforces the bond between the child and



caregiver.

- Implementation:



  * Sit with the Child:



    + When a child is upset or acting out, sit with them in a quiet space. Hold their hand or



sit them on your lap, offering comfort and support.

  * Acknowledge Emotions:



    + Verbally acknowledge their feelings. “I see you’re upset because it’s time to clean up.



It’s okay to feel sad.”

  * Teach Calm-Down Techniques:



    + Help them calm down by teaching deep breathing, counting to five, or using a



calming toy.

#### Consistent Routines
- Explanation



  * Routines provide structure and predictability, which are essential for young children.



  * Knowing what to expect reduces anxiety and helps children feel secure, which in turn reduces



behavioral issues.

- Implementation:



  * Daily Schedule:



    + Keep a consistent daily schedule for activities such as meals, naps, playtime, and



cleanup.

    + For example, always having snack time at 10:00 AM helps children anticipate what’s



next.

  * Transition Cues:



    + Use songs, visuals, or verbal cues to signal transitions between activities.



    + For example, a specific clean-up song can indicate that it’s time to put away toys.



  * Patience with Transitions:



    + Allow extra time for transitions, as young children often need more time to adjust



from one activity to another.

    + Never allow the children to walk alone in the hallway.




#### Modeling Appropriate Behavior
- Explanation



  * Children learn by observing the adults around them.



  * Modeling the behavior you want to see in children teaches them how to act in different



situations.

- Implementation:



  * Demonstrate Sharing and Cooperation:



    + Show how to share toys or take turns during play.



    + For example, “It’s my turn to play with the truck, and then it’s your turn.”



  * Use Calm Words and Tone:



    + When addressing a child, use a calm voice and kind words, even when correcting



behavior.

    + This teaches them to communicate calmly and respectfully.



  * Show Empathy:



    + If a child is upset, model empathy by acknowledging their feelings. “I see that you’re



upset because the block tower fell down. Let’s build it together.”

#### Ignoring Minor Misbehavior
- Explanation



  * Sometimes, children act out to gain attention.



  * Ignoring minor misbehaviors can help extinguish them if they realize they won’t get the



desired response.

  * This method should be used selectively and paired with positive reinforcement for good



behavior.

- Implementation:



  * Assess the Behavior:



    + Determine if the behavior is a minor issue that can be safely ignored, like whining or



mild pouting.

  * Stay Neutral:



    + Avoid giving the behavior attention, whether positive or negative.



    + Remain neutral and continue with the activity at hand.



  * Reinforce Positive Behavior:



    + As soon as the child engages in appropriate behavior, provide positive reinforcement.



    + For example, if they stop whining and ask for something politely, praise them



immediately.

#### Using Simple Language
- Explanation



  * Young children are still developing their language skills, so using simple, clear language



helps them understand what you want from them.

  * This method reduces confusion and frustration.



- Implementation:



  * Short Sentences:



    + Use short, direct sentences when giving instructions.



    + For example, “Sit down, please,” instead of a longer explanation.



  * Use Visuals and Gestures:



    + Combine words with gestures or pictures to help convey the message.



    + Pointing to a chair while saying “Sit” helps reinforce the command.



  * Repeat and Reinforce:



    + Repetition helps young children remember rules and instructions.



    + For example, consistently saying “Hands to yourself” and gently guiding their hands



away from others will help them learn.

#### Empathy and Understanding
- Explanation



  * Understanding a child’s perspective and showing empathy helps build trust and a secure



relationship.

  * It also teaches children to understand and express their own emotions in a healthy way.



- Implementation:



  * Acknowledge Feelings:



    + Validate the child’s emotions by naming what they’re feeling.



    + For example, “I see you’re frustrated because it’s hard to put the puzzle together.



    + Let’s try it together.”



  * Be Patient and Attentive:



    + Give the child your full attention when they’re upset.



    + This shows them that their feelings are important and that they can rely on you for



comfort.

  * Teach Emotion Words:



    + Help children learn to express their feelings by teaching them words for different



emotions. “You’re feeling mad because your toy broke.

  * It’s okay to feel mad. Let’s see how we can fix it.



- EL daycares, uses these methods of discipline to foster a positive, supportive environment thus



helping children develop self-control, empathy, and good social skills without using any kind of
corporal punishment.

### Creativity and discipline.
#### What are creativity and discipline?
- Creativity: is creating new ideas and new actions in a playful way.



- Discipline: is acting based on rules from an authority without questioning.




#### Rule to decide if creativity or discipline is better.
- Discipline is crucial when there is a risk of injury, damage to property, or financial loss.



- When discipline is necessary, it should be gentle and appropriate to the situation.



- For example, if a child is engaging in harmful behavior (e.g., playing with unsafe objects), discipline



should protect them from immediate harm.

- Gentle discipline, such as removing a toy or redirecting attention, is more effective than harsh



punishment.

- The goal is to guide behavior rather than suppress creativity.




#### How to develop creativity or discipline in a child
- Discipline:



  * There are rewards or punishments from authority.



  * Heavy reward/punishment results in heavy discipline.



  * Gentle reward/punishment results in gentle discipline.



  * *even a gentle reward decreases creativity*



  * Gentle rewards and minimal punishments help preserve a child’s creative spirit, as they focus



more on the intrinsic joy of the activity rather than pleasing adults or avoiding punishment.

  * When discipline is necessary, it should be gentle and appropriate to the situation. For



example, if a child is engaging in harmful behavior (e.g., playing with unsafe objects),
discipline should protect them from immediate harm.

  * Gentle discipline, such as removing a toy or redirecting attention, is more effective than harsh



punishment.

  * The goal is to guide behavior rather than suppress creativity.



- Creativity:



  * With creativity there is no reward or punishment from the authority.



  * When they freely decide to try or do something then they create a desire inside them to do it.



  * Give the child space to decide what they want to do. children need space where there are



minimal risks, allowing them to play and explore without strict rules or immediate
consequences.

  * Creativity in children flourishes when they feel safe and free to explore without fear of injury



or significant loss (e.g., health, money, or possessions).

  * Creativity thrives in environments where children are allowed to make their own choices and



follow intrinsic motivation rather than external rewards or punishments.

  * Both discipline and creativity can be developed together by allowing children to experience



minor, controlled consequences (e.g., letting a child climb stairs and feeling the discomfort
before intervening).

  * The environment can also serve as a form of "discipline" when children naturally face the



consequences of their actions in safe, controlled settings.

  * The key is creating a balance between giving children the freedom to explore creatively and



knowing when to introduce structure or discipline for their safety or learning.

## Stimulating the Kids
- Stimulating children who are two years old and below in EL daycares involves engaging children’s



senses, encouraging exploration, and fostering early development.

- Here are some ways to do that:




### Sensory Play
#### Textures and Materials
- Introduce a variety of materials such as soft fabrics, sponges, and textured toys,...etc.



- For example; you can create a sensory bin filled with rice, beans, or sand, and hide small toys inside



for them to find.

- This stimulates their sense of touch and helps develop fine motor skills. Rotating the materials keeps



the experience fresh and exciting.

- Provide different sound-making objects like shakers, bells, or drums.



- You can even create instruments using household items like filling plastic bottles with beans or rice.



- Singing familiar songs and rhymes like "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" not only entertains but also



supports early language development.

- Encourage them to mimic the sounds they hear, which helps with auditory discrimination.




### Routine and Structure
#### Consistent Routine
- Establish a predictable daily routine that includes time for meals, naps, outdoor play, and structured



activities.

- For example, start the day with a morning circle time where you sing a welcome song and talk about



the day’s activities.

- Consistency in routine helps children feel secure and understand what to expect, reducing anxiety



and tantrums.

#### Positive Reinforcement:
- Use positive reinforcement to encourage desired behaviors.



- Praise children when they share toys, follow directions, or complete a task.



- Simple phrases like “Good job!” or “Well done!” along with a smile or clap can significantly boost



their self-esteem and encourage them to continue positive behaviors.

### Language Development
#### Talking and Naming:
- Engage in frequent conversation with the children, even if they aren’t fully verbal yet.



  * Describe what they are doing, seeing, or feeling.



  * For example, if they are playing with blocks, you might say, “You’re building a tall tower. I



see a red block right here in the middle.” This interaction helps them associate words with
actions and objects, fostering early language development.

- Leave pauses between conversations so the child can have space to focus and process.



  * Too much constant conversation distracts the child from their independent playful focus.



  * Pauses also give the caregiver space to assess the child’s intention and situation, and plan



strategies for next steps, etc.

#### Simple Commands
- This includes teaching children to follow simple commands like "clap your hands," "sit down," or



"touch your nose."

- Positive aspects and outcomes:



  * ^Discipline, vCreativity



    + Develops and practices discipline and respect for caregivers.



    + Helps the child learn to set healthy boundaries on their creativity, helping the child's



ability to focus.

  * It also aids in language comprehension, developing listening the child's skills.



- Negative aspects and outcomes:



  * Commands will decrease the child's creative activity. Overuse of commands can make the



child bored and frustrated. Their creativity in daycare spaces may decrease.

- Good practices



  * You can make it fun by turning it into a game or song.

## Preserving the Privilege of Learning
### Scenario: Chege vs. Duru
Let us imagine two 18-month-old children in different daycares.

**Chege:**
- Reading is only mentioned when adults are serious or angry



- Books are kept on high shelves



- Flashcards are flashed when the child is sad, disinterested or angry




**Duru:**
- Books are toys and math is a game



- Child doesn't know that reading is "supposed to be" hard



- Reading and math are all fun, exciting, and part of play activities




**Answer the following questions:**
- Which child is likely to love reading?



- Which child is likely to love Math?




**Goal of EL Interaction:** To transform children's natural curiosity into a lifelong love for reading and Math through play.

A child who enjoys reading becomes unstoppable. When books and learning are treated as special privileges---as "candy" for the mind---children naturally want more.

### Introduction: Our Two-Part Mission
This section presents a two-part approach to understanding and applying the privilege philosophy in EL daycares:

- **Part I: The Foundation** - Establishing the core philosophy on privileges, what they are, how they are earned, and how they teach responsibility in all areas of our daycare.



- **Part II: The Special Application** - Applying that same philosophy to our most critical mission: making learning a joy. We transform books and flashcards from "lessons" into the most exciting, earned privileges we can offer.




### Part I: The Foundation of Privilege
#### What is a Privilege?
A privilege is not a right.

**A right** is something every child gets, no matter what. This includes:
- Food



- A clean diaper



- Safety



- Our love and affection




We never take away a right.

**A privilege** is something special and extra that is earned. Here is the simple breakdown:

**It's something special:**
- Examples: Getting to choose the first flashcard, picking the book for story time, or choosing the song during our big group time.




**It's given because of good choices:**
- Examples: A child earns it by being a good listener, being kind to a friend, or helping clean up.




**It can be paused or removed if it's misused:**
- Examples: If the "special toy" is thrown, the privilege of playing with that toy is paused.




**It can be earned back:**
- This is the most important part! It gives the child a clear path to try again and succeed.




#### Common Privileges in EL Daycares
At Everything is Learning daycares, common privileges include:
- Playing with a specific favorite toy (like tyres and big black ball)



- Being a "Teacher's Helper" (like the line leader or snack helper)



- Getting a few extra minutes of a fun activity, like outdoor time



- Going upstairs at specific locations



- A special, one-on-one session with books or flashcards (this is a key privilege that we'll focus on in Part II)




**Important Note:** This is not a punishment. We must avoid turning this into a negative. Our focus is 100% on learning from choices. Our tone should always be calm, firm, and respectful.

#### How Privileges Connect to EL Techniques
The privilege philosophy fits perfectly with the "Everything is Learning" (EL) techniques we already use every day:

**Followed Interest:**
- When a child is playing gently and is focused on an activity, we let them continue



- The privilege they earn from their good choices is getting more time with that preferred activity




**Flashcard Tease:**
- This is a perfect example



- The child's engagement and focus earn them the privilege of seeing the next card



- It's a small, in-the-moment reward for their attention



- This idea of turning learning into an exciting, earned "game" is the focus of Part II




**Decision-Making Power:**
- When we see a child making good decisions (like sharing or walking safely), we give them more trust and new opportunities



- That new trust is the privilege they have earned




**Self-Evaluation:**
- When a privilege is paused, we can talk with the child



- "What happened with the toy? What's a better choice for next time?"



- This helps the child see how their own choice affected the outcome




**Key Message:** Every privilege we give must teach responsibility.

### Part II: Keeping Book Reading and Flashcards Special
#### Why We Are Here
We want to protect the joy of reading:
- We never want reading to feel like pressure or hard work



- Learning should feel like a special treat, like candy!



- When books and flashcards are treated as a special reward, the child will want to have them more



- A child who enjoys reading will become a reader for life




**Key Idea:** The best words for learning come from the child's own life. When learning is about them, it is very powerful.

#### Core Beliefs
Let's affirm these together:
- The child leads



- The book is candy



- Flashcards are candy



- A special privilege can be lost and must be earned back



- We stop before the child wants to stop



- We never promise treats for reading. The book is a treat.




#### How to Preserve the Privilege
##### How to Use Flashcards (as a Privilege)
**Be a Detective First (Follow Interest):**
- Watch the child



- Are they playing with a ball? Get the "ball" flashcard



- Words must come from their world, not from you




**Store Them Specially (Limit Access):**
- Keep the flashcards in a "special box" or on a high shelf



- They are not regular toys




**Make It a "Surprise" Game (Tease Learning):**
- Show excitement: "I have something so fun!"



- Show the card for one second and say the word clearly: "Mpira!"



- Quickly hide it behind your back



- Smile and ask, "Mpira umeenda wapi?"



- Show it again quickly ("Hapa uko!") and celebrate




**Stop at the Peak (Peak-End Rule):**
- After 1 or 2 cards (30 seconds!), while the child is still laughing and wants more, you stop



- Put the cards back in the special box and say, "Wow, so fun! We will play again tomorrow."




**Handle Misuse Calmly:**
- If the child grabs, bends, or throws the card, calmly take it back



- Say, "Oh, cards are special. We're all done with cards for today."



- You are not angry; you are just protecting the special game




##### How to Read Books (as a Privilege)
**Make It an Invitation (Follow Interest):**
- Don't say, "Sit down, it's reading time."



- Instead, you sit with a book and look excited



- Say, "Wow! Look at this big truck!"



- Let them choose to come to you




**Let the Child Lead:**
- Let them hold the book and turn the pages



- If they want to skip 5 pages, you skip 5 pages



- If they just want to point at the words, you just point and read them




**Read the Words as the Treat:**
- When you get to a word they might know (like "truck"), point to it and read it with energy



- The "reading" part is just another fun piece of the game, not a test




**Stop Before They Are Bored (Peak-End Rule):**
- The moment the child starts to look away, or gets tired, you be the one to end it



- Close the book with a smile and say, "What a great story! We will read more later."




**Protect the Book (Limit Access):**
- Treat the book gently. Say, "We turn pages carefully."



- If the child throws or rips the book, calmly take it and put it away



- "Books are special. We'll try again when we're ready to be gentle."




#### Communication Guidelines
**Caregivers should practice saying:**
- "You earned your flashcards today, well done."



- "We will continue tomorrow."



- "Books are special; we handle them gently."



- "When we throw flashcards, we lose the privilege."




**What we NEVER say:**
- "If you read well, I will give you candy."



- "Sit down and finish reading."



- "Why are you not reading like others?"




#### Key Reminder
A child who enjoys reading becomes unstoppable. Our job is to protect that joy every single day.

## Give the child the decision-making power
### Self-Ownership→Creativity→Focus→Learning
- If the child decides they want to do some action on their own,



  * then they feel ownership of that action,



  * and they will be creative in their approach,



  * and this creativity will stimulate their mind to focus on exploring the current activity



  * then this focus will cause them to remember and learn!




### Authority’s Claim→Discipline→Avoidance
- If an authority figure gives out commands, bribes, and/or punishments about an action, then the child



feels like a foreigner, employee, or trespasser around that action, and they will do less of the action,
as little as possible, just enough to:

  * achieve the rewards, maybe



  * avoid the punishments, maybe



  * and return to their other favorite owned activities.



- Since they are more focused on the rewards, punishments, and preferred other activities, they aren’t



focused on exploring the current activity.

- Thus they don’t remember or learn about the current activity.




### Let the child decide!
- By letting the child decide, you allow them to stimulate themselves to learn creatively.



- Let them decide:



  * How and where to sit



  * What activity to do



  * What they are interested in



- You can control some aspects of their activity indirectly through:



  * The environment:



    + Placing, removing, and arranging furniture and toys



    + Allowing or removing other children from the room



- Your adult behavior:



  * Children often will naturally imitate your behavior, and be interested in your actions



    + Communication



- Language is very powerful in the child’s mind.



- If you tell an interesting story, but leave the ending blank, the child may want



to find out the ending.

- If you tell a story about something that happened inside a box, but delay



telling the ending, the child may reach for the box to look inside.

- Thus, we can control the childrens’ behavior powerfully, but indirectly,



through stories and songs.

- The caregiver is challenged to manage the children in 6 ways:



  * so that the children have more good behavior



  * guided indirectly by their environment, self-chosen imitation of adult behavior, and



self-chosen interest in the adults’ communication

  * with less rewards and punishments



  * thereby increasing their focus and learning




## Teasing versus Pushing
### Objective:
- To ensure all EL caregivers understand the balance between encouraging learning and avoiding



stress, boredom or frustration in the child while implementing the EL techniques.

#### Overview of the El Method
- The EL Method is based on the idea that infants/toddlers are capable of learning at an early age if



they are given information in an enjoyable and engaging manner.

- Teaching involves brief, joyful, and consistent sessions to stimulate the child’s brain development.




#### Key Principles of Learning for our infants/toddlers under 36 Months in our EL daycares
- Learning is Fun



- Infants/toddlers should associate learning with happiness and excitement.



- Sessions must end before the child loses interest.



- Respect the Child’s Pace




Each child is unique; watch for cues of readiness and adjust accordingly.

#### Understanding Teasing vs Pushing
★ Teasing (Positive Encouragement)
Definition: Gently encouraging the child with enthusiasm, presenting learning as a
game.
Characteristics:
.Playful and engaging.
.Uses a loving tone of voice.
.No expectations of immediate success.
.Celebrates any small step or attempt.
Examples:

-Presenting words or books with excitement: “Look at this fun word! Isn’t it cool?”
-Stopping when the child shows signs of disinterest, with a cheerful, “We’ll come back to
this later!”

★ Pushing (Negative Pressure)
Definition: Forcing the child to learn or continue beyond their interest, creating stress or
resentment.
Characteristics:

-Rigid and demanding tone.
-Focuses on achieving specific outcomes.
-Ignore the child’s mood or fatigue.
-Continues even when the child is disinterested or frustrated.
Examples:
.Repeating a session after the child has clearly disengaged.
.Showing frustration: “Why won’t you pay attention?”

- Recognizing the Child’s Cues



- Positive Cues




.Smiling, laughing, or clapping.
.Eagerly engaging with the materials.
.Looking at or touching flashcards or books.

- Negative Cues



.Turning away, whining, or crying.
.Fidgeting or trying to leave the activity area
.Showing fatigue (e.g., rubbing eyes).
❖ Essential elements to Foster a Joyful Learning Environment
1. Prepare in Advance
Organize materials to ensure smooth and quick sessions.
2. Be Enthusiastic
Your energy sets the tone for the session.

3. Keep Sessions Brief.
Follow the principle: Always leave the child wanting more.
Praise effort, not outcomes: “Great job looking at the word!”
5. Adapt to the Child’s Needs (Follow child’s interest).
Be flexible and responsive to the child’s interest/needs.
D. Practical Scenarios and Solutions
Scenario 1: The child looks bored.
Solution: Stop immediately and say, “That’s all for now, we’ll play again later!”
Scenario 2: Th e child is excited but restless.
Solution: Shorten the session while maintaining enthusiasm.

Scenario 3: The child cries during a session.
Solution: Gently comfort the child and discontinue the session without expressing
disappointment.
E. Caregiver Role and Mindset
. Be Observant: Watch for the child’s emotional and physical response always.
. Be Patient: Learning is a journey, not a race.
. Focus on the Bond: Your loving interaction is more important than the material taught.
Note:

- This training aims to empower caregivers to create a nurturing and joyful learning



experience, ensuring the child’s development progresses naturally and positively!
