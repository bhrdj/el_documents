### 1.0.2 Games
#### 1.0.2.1 Dancing games.
- Introducing a dancing game to the children in a daycare setting can be a lot of fun! Here’s a simple



and engaging way to do it.

- Make sure the space where the children will dance is free of obstacles.



- Remove any toys or furniture that could be a distraction.



- If possible, use a soft surface like a rug or mats where the children can comfortably move around.



- Bring the children together in a circle.



- You can sit down with them first to explain what’s going to happen in a simple way. For example,



say, “We’re going to play a fun game where we dance to the music!”

- Keep it very basic. “When the music plays, we dance. When the music stops, we freeze like a



statue!” (This can add a playful challenge).

- Start by showing them a few simple moves.



- Clap your hands, stomp your feet, or spin around. Encourage the children to copy what you’re doing.



- Make your movements big and clear so they’re easy to imitate. Smile and show enthusiasm to make



it more inviting.

- Once they’re engaged, mix it up with different actions. “Now, let’s march in place!” or “Let’s shake



our hips!”

- For very young children, demonstrate each action before expecting them to follow along.



- Hand out scarves, ribbons, or lightweight fabric for them to wave around as they dance.



- You could also use musical instruments like tambourines or shakers for added fun.



- Praise their creativity by saying things like, “Wow, I love how you’re spinning!” or “Great jumping!”



- Give lots of praise and encouragement. Say things like, “You’re all such great dancers!” or “That



was so much fun!”

- Gather the children in a circle at the end, maybe sitting down together. Sing a soft, ./calming song



like “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star” to signal the end of the game.

- Briefly show dance-related word-cards during the dance activity.




#### 1.0.2.2 Hide and Seek
- This is a game where one closes his eyes for a time, and the rest of the team go elsewhere to hide.



- After some time, the person goes to find them and if you find one he loses the game.



- If there is one who is not found from where he is hiding he becomes a winner.



A song for hide and seek is:
Pirikisho ee (Banturee)
Pirikisho ee (Banturee)
Ni hivyo (hapana)

Ni hivyo (hapana).
You can also introduce this game to “gari class.”

- Here are the tips:



  * Use a small, confined space like a corner of the room or a play area where the child feels



secure and is easy to monitor.

  * Make sure there are simple and safe hiding spots, like behind a large cushion, a low table, or



even just covering their face with their hands (peekaboo style).

  * Start with a game they’re likely familiar with, like “pirikisho ee”. You can say, “Where’s



[child’s name]? “Banturee!” There you are!” This helps them understand the idea of someone
being hidden and then found.

  * Instead of having the child hide, you can hide a favorite toy under a blanket or behind an



object and ask, “Where’s the teddy bear?” Encourage the child to find it.

  * Hide yourself in a very obvious spot, like behind a chair or a doorframe, where the child can



easily find you. Then call out to them, “Where’s [Your Name]?” and when they see you,
celebrate with, “You found me!”

  * The first few times, hide together with the child. For example, both of you can hide behind a



curtain or under a blanket, and then you can peek out together.

  * Keep the game very brief, as 1-year-olds have short attention spans. Just a couple of rounds



of finding or being found is enough.

  * Give lots of praise and smiles when they participate. For example, if they pull the blanket off



the hidden toy, say, “You found it! Great job!”

  * Use simple language and gestures. If you’re hiding a toy, show them where it’s going, and



say, “Let’s find it together!”

  * Celebrate every small success with clapping, cheering, and lots of positive reinforcement.



This makes the game more exciting for them.

  * If the child doesn’t seem interested in hiding or seeking, don’t force him/her. Instead, move



on to another activity they enjoy. The goal is to make it fun and stress-free.

  * If the child doesn’t seem interested in hiding or seeking, don’t force it. Instead, move on to



another activity they enjoy. The goal is to make it fun and stress-free.

  * After a couple of rounds, transition to a calming activity like singing a familiar song or



reading a book. This helps wind down the excitement of the game.

What is small grouping?

- Small grouping is where the child is monitored,guided and gets better social interaction by the



caregiver.

- Caregiver’s engagement is less and let them struggle(problem solving).They only watch and



supervise them.

- In this session children also are organized into smaller groups where purposefully are manageable in



group’s activities,learning and supervision.

- They are grouped based on age or other factors like Special educational needs,..etc.



- This small group allows caregivers to provide more individualized attention to better fit different



needs of each child, ensuring the child's safety and better controlled daycare learning environment.

- Example of small groups:



  * one on one activity e.g: reading flashcards / book,letter recognition play,



  * Story telling e.g: Narrating stories to the child,...etc



  * sensory play e.g: sand play,water play,sensory bins,..etc



  * Pretend play e.g: imaginative play with toys,..etc



  * Games e.g: Card game,singing game,..etc



- Procedures to follow



  * Divide the children according to their ages/readiness.

### 1.0.4 Observation.
- Spend Quality Time Watching:



- Start by dedicating time to simply observe the child during different parts of the day, especially



during free play.

- Notice what they are naturally drawn towards-whether it’s a specific toy, activity, or area of the



room.

- Take note of their facial expressions, body language, and how long they stay engaged with certain



activities.

- For example, if a child consistently spends a lot of time at the art station, it may indicate a strong



interest in creative expression.

- Look for Patterns:



  * Over a period of days or weeks, look for recurring themes in the child’s play.



  * Do they often choose the same types of toys (e.g., vehicles, animals, blocks)? Do they engage



in the same type of activity (e.g., building, pretend play, exploring textures)?

  * Document these observations in a notebook record to help identify long-term interests and



preferences.

#### 1.0.5.1 Engage in Conversations:
- For children who are verbal, engage them in conversations about their activities. Ask open-ended



questions like, “What are you building?” or “Tell me about your drawing.”

- Listen carefully to their responses, as they can provide insights into what excites them.



- If a child repeatedly talks about a certain topic (e.g., dinosaurs, princesses, trucks), it signals a strong



interest that you can explore further.

#### 1.0.5.2 Interpret Non-Verbal Cues:
- For younger children or those who are not yet speaking fluently, pay close attention to their gestures,



facial expressions, and the sounds they make during play.

- These cues can communicate joy, frustration, curiosity, or boredom.



- For example, if a child smiles and claps their hands when playing with water, it indicates they enjoy



sensory experiences.

- Conversely, if they turn away or become disengaged, it might mean the activity doesn’t interest



them.

### 1.0.6 Engagement
#### 1.0.6.1 Offer Activities that Align with Their Interests:
- Based on your observations and listening, create activities that reflect the child’s interests.



- If a child loves animals, create an animal-themed day with activities like animal puzzles, books about



animals, and a pretend play farm setup.

- Ensure that these activities are varied in type—include sensory play, physical activities, art, and



pretend play to cater to different aspects of their interest.

#### 1.0.6.2 Enhance and Expand Their Interests:
- Introduce new materials or challenges that build on their current interests.



- For instance, if a child enjoys building with blocks, provide them with a variety of blocks (different



shapes, sizes, or textures) or introduce construction vehicles to extend their play.

- Encourage the child to think creatively and explore new ways to engage with their favorite activities.



- For example, if they love drawing, introduce pencils, crayons or different types of paper to broaden



their experience.

- If a child loves stacking cups, introduce rings or soft blocks. The idea is to provide variety without



losing the essence of what they love.

### 1.0.7 Flexibility
#### 1.0.7.1 Be Ready to Adapt:
- While session plans are important in EL daycares, be flexible enough to adjust your plans based on



the child’s current interests.

- If they are deeply interested in a particular activity, allow them to continue rather than rushing them



to the next scheduled activity.

- Recognize that a child’s interest might change from day to day.



- Stay tuned to these changes and be prepared to shift your approach to accommodate their evolving



preferences.

#### 1.0.7.2 Follow Their Lead:
- Let the child take the lead in activities. If they want to build a tower instead of playing with the toy



kitchen, support their choice.

- This encourages independence and fosters a sense of ownership over their learning and play.



- Offer gentle guidance only when needed, allowing them to explore and experiment on their own.



This autonomy helps them develop confidence and problem-solving skills.

- If they are deeply engaged, try not to interrupt with suggestions or new toys. Their concentration is a



sign of deep interest, and uninterrupted play is crucial for learning.

- Match your actions and responses to their pace. If they’re moving slowly, slow down too; if they’re



excited and quick, respond with similar energy.

- Children often know what they want to do. Allow them to guide the play session without too much



redirection.

- Narrate what’s happening in the moment. For example, “You’re pushing the car! Vroom, vroom!”



This builds their vocabulary and keeps the interaction engaging.

- Once you identify what they enjoy, join in. This doesn’t mean taking over but rather participating in



a way that enhances their experience.

### 1.0.8 Provide Choices
#### 1.0.8.1 Create a Choice-Rich Environment:
- Set up different activity stations in the room, each catering to different interests (e.g., a reading



corner, a sensory table, a pretend play area, and an art station).

- Rotate materials and toys regularly to keep things fresh and engaging.



- Allow the child to choose where they want to play and what they want to play with. This empowers



them and shows that you value their preferences.

- Regularly rotate toys to keep the environment stimulating. If a child loves soft toys, swap them with



others that have different textures or sounds.

#### 1.0.8.2 Balance Freedom with Structure:
- While offering choices, also provide some structure by setting time limits or suggesting transitions



between activities.

- This balance helps children explore their interests while also learning to adapt to routines.




### 1.0.9 Document and Reflect
#### 1.0.9.1 Keep a Record of Interests:
- Maintain a journal where you document the child’s interests, activities they enjoy, and any significant



observations.

- Include notes on how their interests develop over time and how they respond to different activities.




#### 1.0.9.2 Reflect and Plan Ahead:
- Regularly review your notes and reflect on how you can further support the child’s interests.



- Use this reflection to plan future activities, ensuring that you are continuously aligning with their



evolving preferences.

- Collaborate with colleagues to share insights and get ideas on how to enhance the child’s experience



in the daycare.

### 1.0.10 Communication with Parents
#### 1.0.10.1 Ask the manager to allow you Share Observations with Parents:
- Regularly communicate with the child’s parents through the manager's approval about their interests



and activities in daycare.

- Provide updates through brief conversations during pick-up and drop-off times.



- Ask parents if they’ve noticed similar interests at home and if they have any suggestions or insights



that could be incorporated into the daycare environment.

#### 1.0.10.2 Involve Parents in the Process:
- Encourage parents to share materials or ideas that align with their child’s interests.



- Work together with parents to create a consistent experience that supports the child’s interests both at



home and in daycare.

### 1.0.11 Encourage Social Interaction
#### 1.0.11.1 Facilitate Group Activities Based on Common Interests:
- If you notice that several children share a common interest (e.g., riding tires, building blocks, or



water play), organize group activities that allow them to explore this interest together.

- This not only deepens their engagement but also helps develop social skills like sharing, cooperation,



and communication.

- Guide the children in collaborative play, encouraging them to share ideas, take turns, and work



together on a common project (e.g., building a large block tower or creating a group artwork).

#### 1.0.11.2 Promote Peer Learning:
- Encourage children to learn from each other by pairing those with similar interests or skills.



- For example, if one child is particularly good at puzzles, they can help another child who is just



learning how to fit the pieces together.

- Create opportunities for children to showcase their work or explain their favorite activities to others.



- This builds confidence and fosters a sense of community in the daycare



Stories Of The Followed Interest:
9/10/2023

- During the outside activities session I pretended to be a rabbit (sungura). Five other kids came, and



each said they were a different animal: simba, mbwa, dudu choma, paka, and panya.

- We had a game of animals as I quickly wrote the five cards. I placed them inside their sweaters, and



each kid walked like their chosen animal.

- When they got inside, they saw a cockroach and they all assembled together to see it. So I went and



wrote the word “mende.”

- They struggled with it and one killed it, so I placed the dead mende on the “mende” card, then I left



them watching the dead mende.

- After pre-breakfast, Jadah was taking her medicine, and all the kids started saying, “Hata mimi



nilipewa ‘dawa,’” and they all came to see Jadah taking the medicine.

- Mary quickly wrote the word-card “dawa” and I placed the medicine on top of the word card



“dawa.”

- We were outside singing, “Gari ya moshi,” while holding each other at the back.



- While we were walking and singing, someone wrote the word card “gari la moshi.” We put the word



card in the middle and we went round it singing:
Gari ya moshi inaenda sana na mzigo wake
Piga moshi pi! Pi piiiii!
11/10/2023

- During morning free-choice activities, Makena was brought by her father. Almost every kid stopped



what they were doing and went to welcome Makena, saying, “Makena! Makena!Makena!” All of
them wanted to pick her up.

- So, I wrote the word Makena on a card, said “Makena,” and dropped it on the floor. They started



playing with Makena and the word card.

- Afterwards, another kid called Molan came. She had stayed some weeks without coming, she started



crying. They all came and said, “Molan analia !Molan analia!”

- We wrote the word card, “Molan analia” as Wincrease continued soothing him to stop crying



17/6/2024.

- Morning with Blessing and the Bottle



- It was a sunny morning at the daycare, and Blessing, a curious little girl, was on a mission. While the



other kids played with toys, something else caught her eye—a plain, empty plastic bottle on the
table.

- She walked over and carefully picked it up with both hands. Her eyes lit up with curiosity. She



started by shaking the bottle, giggling as it made a crinkling sound.

- The way it felt in her hands and the noises it made seemed so interesting to her.



- I noticed her interest and decided to join in. "What if we put something inside?" I asked. Blessing



nodded eagerly, so I brought over a small container of colorful beads.

- We dropped a few into the bottle, and her face lit up even more when she shook it again. Now, the



bottle made a fun rattling sound.

- Blessing didn’t stop there. She tapped the bottle on the table, on the floor, and even on her knee, each



time listening carefully to the different sounds.

- She turned the bottle upside down, watching the beads tumble from one end to the other, completely



absorbed in her little experiment.

- As snack time approached, I gently guided her to the table, but not before she gave the bottle one last



shake, smiling at her new favorite toy.

- This simple bottle had become a whole world of discovery for Blessing, showing how much joy and



learning can come from following a child’s natural curiosity.

- Following interest of a child according to the stories above refers to observing and understanding the



child’s interest or preferences and tailoring activities/experience that align with all of their interests.

- In our Bethsaida daycare we have effectively as caregivers to pay attention to what our kids enjoy



doing and what they engage in and then we incorporate those elements into their daily routine
through reading flashcards or in any other daycare activities like FCA,Big group, Small group, one
on one,..etc.

- This will help us to foster efficiently our child’s curiosity, both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation,



continuous reading culture and overall development.
Procedures:
1.Observe/ pay attention to what child is interested in
2.Interact with child in his/her interest showing much enthusiasm and curiosity
3.Write word card referring to the child's interest and read aloud without leaving the environment

4.Post the word card where child can access reading/observe it.
5.Provide any other material,toys or opportunities that are of child's interest allowing them(child)
to explore and engage in reading the cards.
6.Encourage the child in his/her interest
7.Offer support or guidance when needed (use your judgment).
8.Where is necessary you can expand the child’s interest by either introducing related
topic(concept) or build up on their current exploration.
9.Give the child freedom to explore his/her interest in their own way ( Be respectful)
Note:

- Time management must be cared on to do not bother other daycare’s routine



- Nurture a child’s development while honoring their unique interest /preference



- Make sure a child has gotten the word card opportunities




## 1.1 Children with Special Educational Needs
Case example: Child “A”
Basic details
Age: 3
Condition: Mild Autism (Asperger)
Description: She is a happy girl. Love to play alone. Non-verbal but producing some sounds,
healthy looking. Has good fine and gross motor skills, Loves to play and stay alone however
she makes few attempts to play with the rest. She has good hearing.
Interventions for the day.
Minimize the noise levels.
Need to provide some independent play items. Colorful flashcards,

Don’t force her to interact with the other children but she should be encouraged to.
Find a way of communicating and getting feedback from visual cards.
Have a routine that should be followed strictly.
Have swings
Have independent play objects
Be strict with her. Always encourage good behavior.
Treat them with a lot of love

## 1.2 Staff with their own kids in the daycare
- Having staff with their own kids in the daycare is not easy and too challenging. Here are some ways



to overcome the situation respectfully;

- Help the kid to be more independent.



- Ignoring the kid sometimes so that he/she might not think that you are always there for him/her only.



- Make sure as a staff member you are doing well all your daycare activities effectively.



- Staff members must not be biased among all the kids.



- Take your kid like others inside the daycare by obeying rules and regulations established to avoid



any internal conflict based on that.

- Having flexible schedules especially to the staff with very little kids.



- To understand their needs when necessary.



- Encouraging effective communication on how the situation is between balancing daycare routine



(work) and caregiving(parenting).

- Encouraging team staff members on sharing the activities/responsibilities



- Recognized and appreciated for the work done and dedication, for both as caregivers and parents all



at once to boost their morale and motivation.

- Disciplining should be done strictly (twice than other kid to show good example)




## 1.3 Flashcards
### 1.3.1 Whaat is Flashcardsan EL flashcard?
### 1.3.2 What should be the size and arrangement of an EL flashcard?
- Size of the text and size of the card depends on the age and ability of the child.



  * “age” = eye development, and “ability” = reading development



  * Layout and spacing for all flashcards:



    + Vertical margins of at-least the height of the letters.



- “vertical margins” = blank space above and below the words to the edge of the



paper.

- Keep the same space between lines, if there are multiple lines of text on the



same card.

  * Horizontal margins of at-least 3 times the width of the letters.



- “horizontal margins” = blank space to the left and right of the words to the



edge of the paper.

    + The word(s) should be centered vertically and horizontally.



    + Flashcards are single-sided.



- Cards for different categories of kids:



  * Cards for new months-old children should be:



    + About 50cm wide and 30cm tall.



    + This is twice as big as sideways A4 paper, which is 29.7cm wide and 21 cm tall.



- The letters on the words should be 10cm tall, and written with thick marker,



with the marker strokes about 1 cm in thickness.\

  * Cards for new children 2 years and older should be:



    + On paper that is about ½ A4 size, cut the long direction



- That is, about 30 cm wide and 10cm tall.



- Using a normal-size thick marker



  * Cards for new children between 12 months and 2 years old should be:



    + In-between the months-old size and the 2 years old size, according to your judgment.



  * Cards for more experienced children:



    + should use a normal-size thick marker,



    + may have multiple words, or a sentence with two or three lines of text,



    + may use sideways A4 size paper to fit the multiple lines of text.




### 1.3.3 Is there any difference between following interest flashcards and one on one
flashcards (set flashcards)?

- Following-interest flashcards during small-group may use a lower-quality paper as they may not



need to be reused.

- Set-flashcards are being reused over a 5-day cycle, two to three times per day. So they should use



manila paper.

- Otherwise, there is no difference in how the words are sized and written.




### 1.3.4 What should be the position of an adult who is flashing cards to a child? Why?
#### 1.3.4.1 There are three main options of positions for flashing cards and reading books:
  * Face to Face (F2F) Position.



    + You are seated, kneeling, or standing leaning over, facing the child directly.



    + Advantage:



- you can see the child’s face and reactions.



    + Disadvantage:



- you aren’t in physical contact with the child, which may decrease your



connection to them.

#### 1.3.4.2 Simple Lap-Sit (SLS) Position.
  * The child is on your lap facing forward and away from you.



  * Advantage:



    + You are in full physical contact with the child, they are happy to be in your lap.



  * Disadvantage:



    + You can’t see their face, so you may not be immediately aware of changes in their



interest and emotions.

#### 1.3.4.3 Three-Point Triangle (3PT) Position
- The child is on your lap facing diagonally towards you



- A triangle is formed by your face, the child’s face, and the book. All three are facing each other.



- Advantage:



  * You are in good physical contact with the child, and also can see their face at the same time.



- Disadvantage:



  * The position is a halfway compromise between the advantages and disadvantages of Face to



Face and Simple Lap-Sit.

- How do you get into position during the flashing card period? Why?



  * If the child is able to stand or crawl,



    + then it’s best if you let them choose their own position on their own.



    + Maybe you place them in a position, whether F2F, SLS, or 3PT.



- But, if they change their position from that point, don’t keep moving them into



your desired position.

- Remember, with flashcards, always “Let the Child Decide”!




### 1.3.5 If they show disinterest in the cards you can try these tricks:
- Put your prepared cards away for a moment and follow their interest.



  * If there isn’t much time left you could skip the flashcard session for that small-group period.



- Let them follow their own interests until they get bored.



  * Maybe their interest will return to your cards after 5 or 10 minutes after they get bored.



  * Maybe play a teasing game with them where you hide the cards from them as they chase after



them.

- Then you:



- might flash one or two cards, and give them to the child for 10 or 20 seconds,



and then put them away.

- Or, you might play whatever game they’re interested in, and make one or two



word-cards out of that, and then:

  * adjust the set of 5 cards so that they include the new words-of-interest



  * continue in later small-groups this day and the next day, etc, with the



new card-set, as normal.

### 1.3.6 Can EL flashcards include pictures? Yes or No? Why?
#### 1.3.6.1 EL flashcards do not include pictures.
#### 1.3.6.2 If we’re putting pictures together with words, we will call those “toys”
##### 1.3.6.2.1 Paper silhouette toy
- This is a paper cut-out silhouette of an object or animal, often laminated.



- The word for that object or animal is written on the paper with a marker in flashcard-style.



- Multiple cards may be assembled and taped together to make a car or dollhouse, etc.




##### 1.3.6.2.2 Word/Picture guessing cards
##### 1.3.6.2.3 Wearables
- These are paper cards that can be worn or otherwise attached to the body with clothespins or string,



etc.

- They may represent parts of the body, clothing, animal masks, etc.



- A word is written somewhere on the card.




## 1.4 What is an EL book?
### 1.4.1 Types of EL books.
#### 1.4.1.1 Favorite-word books are:
#### 1.4.1.2 Storybooks are made according to the IGSSB process:
- Interest→Game→Story→Song→Book



- If the child enjoys the game, you can make it an exciting story.



- If the story is interesting to the child, then you can make it a song so it’s enjoyable to hear multiple



times.

- If the child enjoys the song, then you can make it a book.



  * Pictures



    + Storybooks



- We can put a few pictures in sometimes.



- We place the pictures on separate pages from the words.



- Only the front cover can have words and a picture on the same page.



    + Favorite-word books



- No pictures



- How do we make books?



  * Formatting



    + The formatting of pages in a book is almost the same as formatting individual A4



word-cards.

    + The only difference is you should increase the left margin by an additional 3cm, to



give more space for the stapling/binding.

  * Binding



    + Staples and duct tape



- Explain the IGSSB process in detail with an example?




## 1.5 Daycare games for children aged below 36 months
### 1.5.1 Introduction
- This section is designed to inspire caregivers to use play as a powerful learning tool in supporting



children under 36 months.

- Through simple games that use locally available materials, caregivers can engage children’s senses,



develop motor skills, nurture language, and stimulate curiosity, all while building essential bonds.

- These activities offer more than play—they’re an early foundation for lifelong learning.




### 1.5.2 Importance of Play in Early Childhood Development
- In the EL culture, play is essential for a child’s growth and development.



- For young children, play is their primary “work,” a natural means of exploring the world around



them.

- Each game, each object, and each interaction offers a new opportunity for children to discover, learn,



and grow.

- Play aids in developing cognitive skills, motor coordination, language, social interaction, and



emotional resilience.

- The activities in this section aim to provide purposeful, joyful play that nurtures all aspects of a



child’s development holistically.

### 1.5.3 How to use this section
#### 1.5.3.1 EL-centered principles to keep in mind
##### 1.5.3.1.1 Follow the Child’s Lead
##### 1.5.3.1.2 Adaptability and Flexibility
##### 1.5.3.1.3 Celebrate Small Wins
##### 1.5.3.1.4 Embrace a Multisensory Approach
- Involve all senses in learning.



- Engaging touch, sound, sight, and movement deepens each learning experience.



- Remember you are to pull in some flashcards!




##### 1.5.3.1.5 Stop before the child wants to stop
##### 1.5.3.1.6 Adjusting for Skill Level
##### 1.5.3.1.7 Keeping Activities Fun and Engaging
##### 1.5.3.1.8 Using Everyday Materials
### 1.5.4 Overview of materials used
- One of the greatest strengths of the EL culture is that it’s rooted in resourcefulness, drawing on



inexpensive, everyday materials familiar to the Kenyan context.

- EL uses simple, accessible materials such as cloth scraps, containers, bottle caps, and natural



elements like stones and leaves.

- These materials make the activities feasible for any caregiver, anywhere, while connecting children



to their environment.

- For example, a stick found outdoors can become a tool for a game, connecting play to nature and



building familiarity with the child’s surroundings.

### 1.5.5 Sustainable play and EL values
- Using locally available, sustainable materials aligns with EL values, promoting environmental



awareness and mindfulness from an early age.

- Recycling and reusing materials teach children about the importance of caring for their world.



- This also empowers caregivers to create effective learning experiences without a large budget,



emphasizing that meaningful learning doesn’t require elaborate materials, just imagination, curiosity,
and connection.

- By providing engaging, developmental games that can be played with items readily found in most



households, this book serves as a guide to creating playful, enriched learning environments.

- Whether in daycares, homes, or outdoor spaces, these activities will help children explore, learn, and



flourish as they take their first steps in the journey of learning.

### 1.5.6 Daycare Games
#### 1.5.6.1 Sensory Exploration Games.
- Sensory play is essential for young children as it stimulates their senses and supports cognitive,



language, social, and motor development.

- In this chapter, we will explore various sensory exploration games that utilize inexpensive, locally



available materials, making them accessible for caregivers in Bethsaida daycares and beyond.

##### 1.5.6.1.1 Touch and Texture Activities
###### 1.5.6.1.1.1 Variation 1

- Color Sorting



  * Add small colored stones, leaves, or flowers.



  * Encourage the child to sort them by color as they explore the bin.




###### 1.5.6.1.1.3 Guidelines on playing Touch and Texture games
- Be as jovial as possible



- Act like a child, think like a child



- Be consistent in the use of vocabulary for describing the games; look, here, wow, what is this, I feel



something. This is to enable the child to get some vocabulary.

###### 1.5.6.1.1.4 Ice Play
- Materials Needed:



  * Ice cubes



  * small bowls



  * plastic spoons



- How to Play:



  * Place ice cubes in a bowl and let the child touch, scoop, and move them around.

  * Improves descriptive language, and creativity.




#### 1.5.6.2 Motor Skills Development Games.
- In early childhood, developing motor skills is fundamental to children’s overall growth and



independence.

- Motor skills enable children to interact physically with their environment, engage in play, and



gradually perform everyday tasks independently.

- This chapter provides activities that support children’s fine motor, gross motor, and hand-eye



coordination skills, each of which plays a unique role in building the strength, balance, and control
young children need as they grow.

- The EL culture emphasizes learning through active engagement and discovery, meaning that even



simple, playful movements contribute to foundational development.

- In line with EL principles, the games in this section prioritize children’s freedom to explore at their



own pace, guided gently by caregivers.

- By fostering a nurturing, positive environment, caregivers help children build confidence in their



movements and embrace new challenges.

- Using locally available, inexpensive materials, these games aim to make skill-building accessible to



everyone.

- Caregivers can adapt each activity to suit individual abilities, making these exercises enjoyable and



impactful at any stage of development.
