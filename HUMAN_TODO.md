## Chapter 5: Incomplete Content

**File**: `output/chapters/04_merged/chapter_05_deduplicated.md`

**Issue**: Chapter 5 ends abruptly at line 2550 in section 5.10.7.3 (Language and sounds games).

**Details**:
- The section 5.10.7.3 "Language and sounds games" is only partially complete
- Only subsections 5.10.7.3.1 through 5.10.7.3.5 are present
- The chapter ends in the middle of subsection 5.10.7.3.1.6 "Gentle Instruments Play"
- Missing potential subsections for:
  - Additional age groups (crawling, walking children) for some game types
  - Continuation of language development activities
  - Possible concluding remarks or summary

**Action Needed**:
- [ ] Review original source material to determine if content is truly missing
- [ ] If missing: Source or develop additional content for language and sounds games
- [ ] If complete as-is: Add a proper conclusion to section 5.10.7.3
- [ ] Consider adding chapter summary or closing remarks for Chapter 5
